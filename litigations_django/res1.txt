The SEC charged a Ukrainian hacker, six individual traders in California, Ukraine, and Russia, and two entities.  The hacker and some of the traders were also involved in a similar scheme to hack into newswire services and trade on information that had not yet been released to the public.  The SEC charged the hacker and other traders for that conduct in 2015 (see  ;   and  . The SEC\'s complaint alleges that after hacking the newswire services, Ukrainian hacker Oleksandr Ieremenko turned his attention to EDGAR and, using deceptive hacking techniques, gained access in 2016.  Ieremenko extracted EDGAR files containing nonpublic earnings results.  The information was passed to individuals who used it to trade in the narrow window between when the files were extracted from SEC systems and when the companies released the information to the public.  In total, the traders traded before at least 157 earnings releases from May to October 2016 and generated at least $4.1 million in illegal profits.

Ieremenko obtained nonpublic "test files," which issuers can elect to submit in advance of making their official filings to help make sure EDGAR will process the filings as intended.  Issuers sometimes elected to include nonpublic information in test filings, such as actual quarterly earnings results not yet released to the public.

The SEC\'s complaint alleges that the following traders received and traded on the basis of the hacked EDGAR information: In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the District of New Jersey announced related criminal charges. The SEC\'s complaint charges each of the defendants with violating the federal securities antifraud laws and related SEC antifraud rules and seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to pay penalties, return their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and enjoining them from committing future violations of the antifraud laws.  The SEC also named and is seeking relief from four relief defendants who profited from the scheme when defendants used the relief defendants\' brokerage accounts to place illicit trades.

	 Content: ['The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a subpoena enforcement action against three penny-stock companies and their CEO - Cherubim Interests, Inc. (CHIT), PDX Partners, Inc. (PDXP), Victura Construction Group, Inc. (VICT), and Patrick Jevon Johnson - seeking an order directing them to comply with investigative subpoenas for documents. According to the SEC\'s application, filed on December 21, 2018 in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the SEC is investigating whether certain individuals or entities engaged in a potential pump-and-dump scheme in the stock of CHIT, PDXP, and VICT.  Because the SEC was concerned about the accuracy of the companies\' disclosures, the SEC   trading in their securities on February 15, 2018 for ten business days.  Based on its ongoing investigation, the SEC has reason to believe that each company issued false public statements in January 2018 to "pump" their stock price, claiming that it had acquired hundreds of millions of dollars of "AAA-rated" assets, even though each company appeared to have little to no assets.  After the stock price and trading volume for each company increased as a result of the news, an entity associated with the companies may have "dumped" their overvalued shares for significant profits. In May 2018, the SEC issued subpoenas to CHIT, PDXP, VICT, and Johnson for the production of documents.  According to the SEC\'s application, the companies and Johnson produced a limited number of documents.  All of them refused to produce key documents responsive to the subpoena about matters relevant to their participation in the conduct being investigated. The SEC\'s application seeks an order from the court compelling CHIT, PDXP, VICT, and Johnson to fully comply with the SEC\'s subpoenas.  The SEC previously filed subpoena enforcement actions in   and   2018 against other parties in this matter.  The SEC is continuing its fact-finding investigation in this matter and has not concluded that anyone has violated the securities laws.']

	 Content: ['The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against an additional 13 individuals and 10 companies for unlawfully selling securities of Woodbridge Group of Companies LLC to retail investors. Woodbridge collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2017 and the SEC previously charged the company, its owner and others with operating a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme and charged five of the top Florida-based sales agents for securities and broker-dealer registration violations. The 13 individual defendants charged were among Woodbridge\'s top revenue producers, selling more than $350 million of its unregistered securities to more than 4,400 investors. According to the complaints, the defendants marketed Woodbridge\'s securities as a "safe" and "secure" investment and reaped millions of dollars in commissions on their sales even though they were not registered as, or associated with, registered broker-dealers. The SEC also alleges that defendant Jordan Goodman, a self-described "media influencer," touted Woodbridge without disclosing that he was paid to do so. In its latest actions, the SEC is seeking court-ordered injunctions, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and financial penalties against Robert S.

The SEC also reached settlements in its   Barry M. Kornfeld, Ferne Kornfeld, and Albert D. Klager. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the three agreed to a permanent injunction and to industry and penny-stock bars.

The SEC\'s complaint alleges that the following traders received and traded on the basis of the hacked EDGAR information: In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the District of New Jersey announced related criminal charges. The SEC\'s complaint charges each of the defendants with violating the federal securities antifraud laws and related SEC antifraud rules and seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to pay penalties, return their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and enjoining them from committing future violations of the antifraud laws.  The SEC also named and is seeking relief from four relief defendants who profited from the scheme when defendants used the relief defendants\' brokerage accounts to place illicit trades. The SEC\'s investigation, which is ongoing, was conducted by Market Abuse Unit and Cyber Unit staff David Bennett, Arsen Ablaev, Michael Baker, Jason Burt, Laura D\'Allaird, Adam Gottlieb, James Scoggins, David Snyder, Jonathan Warner, Darren Boerner, and John Rymas, and IT Forensics staff Ken Zavos, Douglas Bond, Stephen Haupt, Gi Nguyen, and Jennifer Ross.  The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Office of Information Technology provided substantial assistance.  The investigation was supervised by Robert Cohen, Joseph Sansone, and Carolyn Welshhans.  Cheryl Crumpton and Stephan Schlegelmilch are leading the SEC\'s litigation.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the District of New Jersey, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.']

	 Content: ['On January 24, 2019, the Honorable Kimba M. Wood of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered judgments against a Manhattan-based lending company, American Growth Funding II, LLC ("AGF II"), and its owner Ralph C. Johnson, who were   with lying to investors who purchased AGF II\'s high-yield securities. The SEC\'s complaint alleged, among other things, that between March 2011 and December 2013, AGF II and Johnson falsely claimed that AGF II\'s financial statements were being audited each year.  The complaint also alleged that AGF II made misrepresentations in its offering documents about its management and concealed details about deteriorating loan values that could imperil full payment of the promised returns to investors. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\'s complaint, AGF II and Johnson consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In addition, the judgment against Johnson requires that he pay a penalty in the amount of $75,000 and disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest.  Under the order, the amount of disgorgement will be decided at a later time, no later than 30 days, either by agreement of the parties or by referral to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate judge will calculate disgorgement as $577,731, less amounts paid by AGF Management II, LLC to unaffiliated third parties (which Johnson must prove by documentation), other than for Johnson\'s benefit. The SEC\'s action against the non-settling defendants continues. For further information, see   (February 3, 2016).']

After the stock price and trading volume for each company increased as a result of the news, an entity associated with the companies may have "dumped" their overvalued shares for significant profits. In May 2018, the SEC issued subpoenas to CHIT, PDXP, VICT, and Johnson for the production of documents.

	 Content: ['The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against an additional 13 individuals and 10 companies for unlawfully selling securities of Woodbridge Group of Companies LLC to retail investors. Woodbridge collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2017 and the SEC previously charged the company, its owner and others with operating a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme and charged five of the top Florida-based sales agents for securities and broker-dealer registration violations. The 13 individual defendants charged were among Woodbridge\'s top revenue producers, selling more than $350 million of its unregistered securities to more than 4,400 investors. According to the complaints, the defendants marketed Woodbridge\'s securities as a "safe" and "secure" investment and reaped millions of dollars in commissions on their sales even though they were not registered as, or associated with, registered broker-dealers. The SEC also alleges that defendant Jordan Goodman, a self-described "media influencer," touted Woodbridge without disclosing that he was paid to do so. In its latest actions, the SEC is seeking court-ordered injunctions, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and financial penalties against Robert S.

The SEC\'s complaint alleged, among other things, that between March 2011 and December 2013, AGF II and Johnson falsely claimed that AGF II\'s financial statements were being audited each year.  The complaint also alleged that AGF II made misrepresentations in its offering documents about its management and concealed details about deteriorating loan values that could imperil full payment of the promised returns to investors. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\'s complaint, AGF II and Johnson consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In addition, the judgment against Johnson requires that he pay a penalty in the amount of $75,000 and disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest.  Under the order, the amount of disgorgement will be decided at a later time, no later than 30 days, either by agreement of the parties or by referral to a magistrate judge.

	 Content: ['The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on January 15, 2019 charges against nine defendants for participating in a previously disclosed scheme to hack into the SEC\'s EDGAR system and extract nonpublic information to use for illegal trading.  The SEC charged a Ukrainian hacker, six individual traders in California, Ukraine, and Russia, and two entities.  The hacker and some of the traders were also involved in a similar scheme to hack into newswire services and trade on information that had not yet been released to the public.  The SEC charged the hacker and other traders for that conduct in 2015 (see  ;   and  . The SEC\'s complaint alleges that after hacking the newswire services, Ukrainian hacker Oleksandr Ieremenko turned his attention to EDGAR and, using deceptive hacking techniques, gained access in 2016.  Ieremenko extracted EDGAR files containing nonpublic earnings results.  The information was passed to individuals who used it to trade in the narrow window between when the files were extracted from SEC systems and when the companies released the information to the public.  In total, the traders traded before at least 157 earnings releases from May to October 2016 and generated at least $4.1 million in illegal profits. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Ieremenko circumvented EDGAR controls that require user authentication and then navigated within the EDGAR system.  Ieremenko obtained nonpublic "test files," which issuers can elect to submit in advance of making their official filings to help make sure EDGAR will process the filings as intended.  Issuers sometimes elected to include nonpublic information in test filings, such as actual quarterly earnings results not yet released to the public.  Ieremenko extracted nonpublic test files from SEC servers, and then passed the information to different groups of traders. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that the following traders received and traded on the basis of the hacked EDGAR information: In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the District of New Jersey announced related criminal charges. The SEC\'s complaint charges each of the defendants with violating the federal securities antifraud laws and related SEC antifraud rules and seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to pay penalties, return their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and enjoining them from committing future violations of the antifraud laws.  The SEC also named and is seeking relief from four relief defendants who profited from the scheme when defendants used the relief defendants\' brokerage accounts to place illicit trades. The SEC\'s investigation, which is ongoing, was conducted by Market Abuse Unit and Cyber Unit staff David Bennett, Arsen Ablaev, Michael Baker, Jason Burt, Laura D\'Allaird, Adam Gottlieb, James Scoggins, David Snyder, Jonathan Warner, Darren Boerner, and John Rymas, and IT Forensics staff Ken Zavos, Douglas Bond, Stephen Haupt, Gi Nguyen, and Jennifer Ross.  The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Office of Information Technology provided substantial assistance.  The investigation was supervised by Robert Cohen, Joseph Sansone, and Carolyn Welshhans.  Cheryl Crumpton and Stephan Schlegelmilch are leading the SEC\'s litigation.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the District of New Jersey, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.']

	 Content: ['The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a subpoena enforcement action against three penny-stock companies and their CEO - Cherubim Interests, Inc. (CHIT), PDX Partners, Inc. (PDXP), Victura Construction Group, Inc. (VICT), and Patrick Jevon Johnson - seeking an order directing them to comply with investigative subpoenas for documents. According to the SEC\'s application, filed on December 21, 2018 in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the SEC is investigating whether certain individuals or entities engaged in a potential pump-and-dump scheme in the stock of CHIT, PDXP, and VICT.  Because the SEC was concerned about the accuracy of the companies\' disclosures, the SEC   trading in their securities on February 15, 2018 for ten business days.  Based on its ongoing investigation, the SEC has reason to believe that each company issued false public statements in January 2018 to "pump" their stock price, claiming that it had acquired hundreds of millions of dollars of "AAA-rated" assets, even though each company appeared to have little to no assets.  After the stock price and trading volume for each company increased as a result of the news, an entity associated with the companies may have "dumped" their overvalued shares for significant profits. In May 2018, the SEC issued subpoenas to CHIT, PDXP, VICT, and Johnson for the production of documents.  According to the SEC\'s application, the companies and Johnson produced a limited number of documents.  All of them refused to produce key documents responsive to the subpoena about matters relevant to their participation in the conduct being investigated. The SEC\'s application seeks an order from the court compelling CHIT, PDXP, VICT, and Johnson to fully comply with the SEC\'s subpoenas.  The SEC previously filed subpoena enforcement actions in   and   2018 against other parties in this matter.  The SEC is continuing its fact-finding investigation in this matter and has not concluded that anyone has violated the securities laws.']

ITEM NUMBER 6:
	 Title: ['SEC Obtains Judgment Against Former CEO in Transition Management Fraud Case']
	 Subtitle: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. John T. Place, et al., No. 16-cv-04291 (E.D. Pa. filed Aug. 8, 2016)
	 Content: ["On November 9, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a judgment against the former CEO of a brokerage consulting business who was charged by the SEC in August for his role in a multimillion dollar transition management fraud. The SEC   a brokerage consulting business known as GTS along with three of its former officers, including former CEO John T. Place, for misleading current and prospective customers about the fees the business charged in connection with securities transactions.  According to the SEC's complaint, Place and other GTS officers told many of their customers that GTS would receive only clearly disclosed commissions charged on customers' trades.  In reality, GTS also received additional revenue from mark-ups and mark-downs charged by other brokers. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Place consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. The amount of any financial penalty and disgorgement to be imposed against Place will be determined at a later date by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Place also consented to the entry of an SEC order, issued on December 20, 2018, barring him from the securities industry.  The SEC resolved its lawsuit against the two entities that comprised GTS in April 2017, obtaining a final judgment against GTS Inc. and dismissing the action against the defunct GTS LLC. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ellen F. Bortz and Richard E. Johnston under the supervision of Jennifer S. Leete.  The SEC's litigation is being led by Daniel J. Maher and Melissa J. Armstrong."]
