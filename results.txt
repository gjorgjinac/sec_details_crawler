['SEC Files Subpoena Enforcement in Possible Market Manipulation Scheme']
['Litigation Release No. 24380 / December 26, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a subpoena enforcement action against three penny-stock companies and their CEO - Cherubim Interests, Inc. (CHIT), PDX Partners, Inc. (PDXP), Victura Construction Group, Inc. (VICT), and Patrick Jevon Johnson - seeking an order directing them to comply with investigative subpoenas for documents. According to the SEC\'s application, filed on December 21, 2018 in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the SEC is investigating whether certain individuals or entities engaged in a potential pump-and-dump scheme in the stock of CHIT, PDXP, and VICT.  Because the SEC was concerned about the accuracy of the companies\' disclosures, the SEC   trading in their securities on February 15, 2018 for ten business days.  Based on its ongoing investigation, the SEC has reason to believe that each company issued false public statements in January 2018 to "pump" their stock price, claiming that it had acquired hundreds of millions of dollars of "AAA-rated" assets, even though each company appeared to have little to no assets.  After the stock price and trading volume for each company increased as a result of the news, an entity associated with the companies may have "dumped" their overvalued shares for significant profits. In May 2018, the SEC issued subpoenas to CHIT, PDXP, VICT, and Johnson for the production of documents.  According to the SEC\'s application, the companies and Johnson produced a limited number of documents.  All of them refused to produce key documents responsive to the subpoena about matters relevant to their participation in the conduct being investigated. The SEC\'s application seeks an order from the court compelling CHIT, PDXP, VICT, and Johnson to fully comply with the SEC\'s subpoenas.  The SEC previously filed subpoena enforcement actions in   and   2018 against other parties in this matter.  The SEC is continuing its fact-finding investigation in this matter and has not concluded that anyone has violated the securities laws.']

['On January 24, 2019, the Honorable Kimba M.

Johnson, who were   with lying to investors who purchased AGF II\'s high-yield securities. The SEC\'s complaint alleged, among other things, that between March 2011 and December 2013, AGF II and Johnson falsely claimed that AGF II\'s financial statements were being audited each year.  The complaint also alleged that AGF II made misrepresentations in its offering documents about its management and concealed details about deteriorating loan values that could imperil full payment of the promised returns to investors. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\'s complaint, AGF II and Johnson consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In addition, the judgment against Johnson requires that he pay a penalty in the amount of $75,000 and disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest.  Under the order, the amount of disgorgement will be decided at a later time, no later than 30 days, either by agreement of the parties or by referral to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate judge will calculate disgorgement as $577,731, less amounts paid by AGF Management II, LLC to unaffiliated third parties (which Johnson must prove by documentation), other than for Johnson\'s benefit. The SEC\'s action against the non-settling defendants continues. For further information, see   (February 3, 2016).']

["On November 9, 2018, Richard G. Cody, a former investment adviser and broker representative whom the Securities and Exchange Commission   with defrauding Massachusetts retirees, pled guilty to criminal charges filed by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. The SEC   on December 12, 2016.  According to the SEC's Complaint, Cody defrauded at least three of his retired clients over a twelve-year period by concealing the fact that their retirement accounts had lost substantial value and were being rapidly depleted. Cody allegedly concealed these losses by leading the clients to believe that their investments were maintaining steady value and that the clients were living off income from their investments.  By 2014, two of the retirees' accounts had essentially run out of funds.  Cody allegedly continued to hide that the retirees' money was gone by making wire transfers of monthly deposits to the retirees' bank accounts and sending the clients fabricated tax forms.  The SEC alleges that these deceptive acts caused Cody's clients to believe that their retirement savings were secure when, in fact, they were not. The criminal charges in the indictment, which was filed on September 26, 2017, arose from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's Complaint against Cody.  The indictment also alleged that Cody lied to the SEC during a March 2017 sworn deposition in connection with the SEC's action against Cody.  Cody allegedly made false declarations during the deposition when he denied that he had provided fraudulent documents to two investors.  Cody pled guilty to the charges and the court accepted Cody's plea.  He is scheduled to be sentenced on February 4, 2019. On December 22, 2016, the SEC obtained a preliminary injunction and an asset freeze against Cody and his company, Boston Investment Partners LLC, from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on January 15, 2019 charges against nine defendants for participating in a previously disclosed scheme to hack into the SEC\'s EDGAR system and extract nonpublic information to use for illegal trading.  The SEC charged a Ukrainian hacker, six individual traders in California, Ukraine, and Russia, and two entities.  The hacker and some of the traders were also involved in a similar scheme to hack into newswire services and trade on information that had not yet been released to the public.  The SEC charged the hacker and other traders for that conduct in 2015 (see  ;   and  . The SEC\'s complaint alleges that after hacking the newswire services, Ukrainian hacker Oleksandr Ieremenko turned his attention to EDGAR and, using deceptive hacking techniques, gained access in 2016.  Ieremenko extracted EDGAR files containing nonpublic earnings results.  The information was passed to individuals who used it to trade in the narrow window between when the files were extracted from SEC systems and when the companies released the information to the public.  In total, the traders traded before at least 157 earnings releases from May to October 2016 and generated at least $4.1 million in illegal profits. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Ieremenko circumvented EDGAR controls that require user authentication and then navigated within the EDGAR system.  Ieremenko obtained nonpublic "test files," which issuers can elect to submit in advance of making their official filings to help make sure EDGAR will process the filings as intended.  Issuers sometimes elected to include nonpublic information in test filings, such as actual quarterly earnings results not yet released to the public.  Ieremenko extracted nonpublic test files from SEC servers, and then passed the information to different groups of traders. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that the following traders received and traded on the basis of the hacked EDGAR information: In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the District of New Jersey announced related criminal charges. The SEC\'s complaint charges each of the defendants with violating the federal securities antifraud laws and related SEC antifraud rules and seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to pay penalties, return their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and enjoining them from committing future violations of the antifraud laws.  The SEC also named and is seeking relief from four relief defendants who profited from the scheme when defendants used the relief defendants\' brokerage accounts to place illicit trades. The SEC\'s investigation, which is ongoing, was conducted by Market Abuse Unit and Cyber Unit staff David Bennett, Arsen Ablaev, Michael Baker, Jason Burt, Laura D\'Allaird, Adam Gottlieb, James Scoggins, David Snyder, Jonathan Warner, Darren Boerner, and John Rymas, and IT Forensics staff Ken Zavos, Douglas Bond, Stephen Haupt, Gi Nguyen, and Jennifer Ross.

Dalius and the Saivian companies falsely claimed that Saivian funded its cash back payments to members by monetizing the point-of-sale receipt data submitted by its members.

['SEC Charges Florida Man in Day Trading Scheme']
['Litigation Release No. 24344 / November 8, 2018']
['On November 7, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Florida resident Ricardo H. Goldman for fraudulently operating an unregistered securities day trading firm. According to the SEC\'s complaint, Goldman misled dozens of day traders into thinking they were opening individual online securities trading accounts with Goldman\'s broker-dealer, America Capital Group LLC, which was not registered with the SEC.  The SEC alleges that between at least November 2010 and August 2015, Goldman raised approximately $6.9 million from traders and then comingled their funds by placing them in a pooled master brokerage account that he controlled.  Goldman allegedly concealed the comingling of the funds by giving traders online access to individual sub-accounts within the pooled master account.  Goldman allegedly profited by charging traders a commission on their trades.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, the pooled account ultimately sustained at least $3.6 million in trading loses.  Because funds were commingled, traders were forced to share in the overall losses incurred in the master account.   The complaint further alleges Goldman made material misrepresentations and omissions to traders regarding his background and disciplinary history which includes antifraud and securities and broker-dealer registration injunctions, a broker-dealer bar, and a state court conviction for grand theft and forgery. The SEC\'s complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of Florida, charges Goldman with violating Sections 10(b), 15(a)(1), and 15(b)(6)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent and conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, and penalties. Upon filing of the Commission\'s complaint, and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Goldman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, imposes a conduct-based injunction, and directs Goldman to comply with the Commission\'s Order dated November 19, 2008, In the Matter of Ricardo H. Goldman (Exchange Rel. No. 58976, Admin. Proc. 3-13293).  The Judgment also orders Goldman to pay disgorgement of $470,000, prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $53,497, and a civil penalty in the amount of $320,000.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission announced fraud charges against musician Paul Gilman and his companies, alleging that nearly all of the money they raised in securities offerings went to fund Gilman\'s lavish personal spending in Las Vegas and California. The SEC\'s complaint charges Gilman used his companies - Oil Migration Group LLC, WaveTech29 LLC and GilmanSound LLC - to fraudulently solicit retail investors, including a nurse, a minister, and a businessman. Gilman, a self-dubbed "Whale Whisperer" who produced and starred in a documentary of his encounters with whales, claimed to be developing a revolutionary "soundwave" technology that would transform the oil and gas industry. According to the complaint, Gilman told OMG and Wavetech investors that he would use their funds to test, validate, further develop, and license the soundwave technology for use in oil and gas industry applications, and he promised the investors substantial profits.  Instead, Gilman is alleged to have used substantially all of the investor funds for his personal benefit, including to pay for luxury Las Vegas hotels, restaurants, designer clothing, and large cash withdrawals at casino ATMs. Gilman also allegedly defrauded investors in GilmanSound, a company he claimed would revolutionize sound systems in sport stadiums. While GilmanSound provided some real services to major-league baseball stadiums, the SEC\'s complaint alleges that a substantial amount of the GilmanSound investor funds also were misused for Gilman\'s personal expenses. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, charges Gilman, Oil Migration Group, Wavetech, and GilmanSound with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

['Litigation Release No. 24157 / June 5, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged two former managers of SEC-registered investment adviser deVere USA, Inc. for allegedly making misleading statements and omissions concerning economic conflicts of interest and other issues. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that former deVere USA CEO, Benjamin Alderson, and a former manager, Bradley Hamilton, misled clients and prospective clients about the benefits of pension transfers while concealing material conflicts of interest, including the substantial compensation that Alderson and Hamilton personally stood to receive.

The SEC separately instituted a settled administrative proceeding against deVere USA.  According to the SEC order, deVere USA failed to disclose agreements with overseas product and service providers that resulted in compensation being paid to deVere USA advisers and an overseas affiliate.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on April 30, 2018, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a default judgment in an ongoing enforcement action against Christopher R. Esposito, the owner and Managing Director of Lionshare Ventures, LLC (Lionshare), in a case involving an alleged scheme to defraud investors by misappropriating investor funds and concealing the ownership and control of a publicly traded company.  The court also entered a final judgement by consent on December 11, 2017, against another defendant in the case, Rene Galizio. The SEC's  , filed on May 26, 2016, alleged a two-part scheme involving Esposito, Lionshare, and several co-defendants.  First, Esposito raised more than $550,000 in investor funds through an unregistered offering of Lionshare securities and then misappropriated $375,000 for his personal benefit.  According to the complaint, Esposito spent almost $300,000 of the funds raised on personal expenses and used $75,000 to acquire control of a Massachusetts-based, publicly traded company, Cannabiz Mobile, Inc., by purchasing all of its convertible debt. In the second phase of the scheme, the SEC's complaint alleged that Esposito and Lionshare, together with co-defendant Anthony Jay Pignatello of Manhattan Beach, California, concealed Esposito and Lionshare's de facto control of Cannabiz and a large percentage of Cannabiz's securities in order to evade SEC Rule 144, which limits securities sales by certain company affiliates, such as control persons.  Esposito allegedly did this by, among other things, installing co-defendant James Gondolfe as the sole officer and director of Cannabiz - even though Esposito and Lionshare secretly controlled the company - to make false statements in Cannabiz's public filings with the SEC and other documents.  According to the SEC's complaint, Esposito paid third-party stock promoters to tout Cannabiz stock in order to increase its price and trading volume.  Both during and after this promotional campaign, Esposito sold significant amounts of Cannabiz convertible debt to others for a profit of almost $304,000.  Esposito, Pignatello, and Galizio also allegedly sold millions of shares of Cannabiz stock directly into the public market for a profit. The final judgment, which was entered against Esposito by default by the Honorable Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, enjoins Esposito from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment also orders Esposito to pay, on a joint and several basis with Lionshare, disgorgement and pre-judgment interest in the total amount of $1,107,413 and a civil penalty of $160,000.  Additionally, the final judgment against Esposito bars him from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and permanently bars him from participating in an offering of a penny stock.

Kaplan, Esq. and three entities he controls, Synchronized Organizational Solutions International Ltd. (SOSI), Synchronized Organizational Solutions LLC (SOS), and Manna International Enterprises Ltd.  In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Kaplan, through the three entity defendants, orchestrated a fraudulent scheme that raised approximately $15.8 million from 26 investors in eight states.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of an Order enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule l0b-5 thereunder, and further enjoining Kaplan from violating Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.

In addition, the Court entered judgments against Relief Defendants Lisa M. Kaplan, the Water-Walking Foundation Inc., and Manna Investments LLC, requiring them to pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest thereon, totaling $1,533,440.61.  The final judgments order that funds subject to an asset freeze the Commission previously obtained be used to partially satisfy the financial obligations. The SEC filed on May 19, 2016 its complaint alleging, among other things, that Kaplan repeatedly lied to prospective investors by stating that their funds would be invested in a low-risk, private off-shore trading program that would provide estimated monthly profits of 10 percent.  The complaint alleges that Kaplan did not use investor funds as promised but instead misused and misappropriated investor funds, falsely represented to investors that their funds were invested, sent out false profit statements indicating that investors had earned returns, and otherwise engaged in a variety of conduct which operated as a fraud and deceit on investors.  The complaint further alleges that Kaplan acted as an unregistered broker. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Raven A. Winters and Luz Aguilar, and supervised by Amy S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office.  The litigation was led by Alyssa A. Qualls.  For further information, see Litigation Release No.   (May 27, 2016)."]

['SEC Charges Connecticut Insurance Executive and Two Companies with Securities Offering Fraud']
['Litigation Release No. 24028 / January 11, 2018']
["The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Connecticut resident David S. Haddad and two companies he operates in connection with a fraudulent scheme to raise funds from retail investors.  Haddad and the two companies have offered to settle the case by, among other things, agreeing to pay a total of over $1 million, which includes disgorgement of money Haddad took in from investors and used for his own personal purposes. The SEC's complaint alleges that Haddad operated two companies in the re-insurance industry, Trafalgar Square Risk Management, LLC and New England RE, LLC.  Haddad allegedly began raising money from investors through the offer and sale of unregistered securities in Trafalgar in or before 2012.  He began offering unregistered New England RE securities to investors in late 2014 and, through the Trafalgar and New England RE offerings, raised at least $2.5 million from at least 29 separate investors.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, while making these offers and sales, Haddad, individually and on behalf of Trafalgar and New England RE, made various misleading claims to investors about the use of their funds.  According to the SEC's complaint, Haddad led investors to believe that their funds would be used to build and grow Trafalgar and New England RE when, in fact, Haddad diverted a significant portion of the investors' money for his own purposes, including the purchase of multiple homes, art and antiques, entertainment, and expenses of a dog rescue charity founded by Haddad.  Haddad also used some investors' money to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors.  The complaint alleges that the money Haddad used to support his lifestyle far exceeded Trafalgar's revenues. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, charges Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of these laws.  Haddad and Trafalgar also have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $619,382.43 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $25,131.83. Haddad and New England Re have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $269,080 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest $2,592.66.  In addition, Haddad has agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $181,071 and has consented to the imposition of a permanent bar prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company.  Haddad further has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from providing information to, soliciting, or accepting investments or funds from any investor or potential investors regarding the offer or sale of any securities issued by any entity that he directly or indirectly owns, controls, consults for, or is employed by, unless he first provides such person with a written disclosure regarding his prior regulatory history and maintains written records of such disclosures.

["On January 9, 2018, Daniel H. Glick, a defendant in ongoing SEC litigation, pled guilty to one count of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C.  1343 in the criminal case United States v. Daniel Glick, No. 17-CR-739.  On November 15, 2017, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois filed a criminal information charging Glick, a Chicago-based investment adviser, with wire fraud. According to the plea agreement, from at least 2011 through at least 2017, Glick engaged in a fraudulent scheme to benefit himself to the financial detriment of his clients and two financial institutions.  According to the plea agreement, as part of the scheme, Glick misappropriated at least $5.2 million dollars from clients, provided financial institutions with forged checks and other documents, and lied to clients about the use, status, and safety of their invested funds.  The plea agreement further states that most of the funds that Glick misappropriated belonged to elderly clients, including his mother-in-law and father-in-law and an individual in a nursing home, and that Glick used some of the stolen funds to pay personal and business expenses. On March 23, 2017, the SEC brought an emergency action against Glick and his unregistered, Chicago-Based investment advisory firm, Financial Management Strategies (FMS), based on substantially the same conduct.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Daniel H. Glick and FMS provided clients with false account statements to hide Glick's use of client funds to, among other things, pay personal and business expenses, purchase a Mercedes-Benz, and pay off loans and debts.  The SEC's action also named three relief defendants, including Glick's accounting firm, Glick Accounting Services. On the same day that it filed its action, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order against Glick and FMS and an asset freeze against Glick, FMS, and Glick Accounting Services.

Monetary remedies against Kaptrosky will be determined by the Court at a later time.

Harmon misappropriated more than $500,000 from individual investors for his own benefit, including for lease payments on a vacation home and his personal residence.  The SEC further alleged that Ash Narayan, who previously settled the SEC's charges, misappropriated more than $2 million from individual investors.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") filed an enforcement action on January 31, 2018, in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, charging two Boston-area investment advisers with defrauding multiple clients by stealing nearly half a million dollars of client assets, along with other breaches of their fiduciary duty.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the District of Massachusetts announced criminal charges against Polese and Peterson. According to the Commission\'s complaint, beginning in 2014, James S. Polese and Cornelius Peterson, while employed as investment advisers at a large financial institution, engaged in various schemes to defraud their clients, including stealing nearly $450,000 from one elderly client.  In March 2016, Polese and Peterson fraudulently misappropriated $350,000 of their client\'s money, using $100,000 of those funds to make investments in their own names, and directing the remaining $250,000 to Polese\'s personal bank account.  Then, from March through May of 2017, Polese made numerous unauthorized withdrawals from the same client\'s account totaling approximately $93,000 to pay Polese\'s credit card and college tuition expenses for Polese\'s children. In addition to stealing client funds, the complaint alleges that Polese and Peterson breached their fiduciary duty to their clients when they (1) secretly put client funds at risk by using a client\'s assets as collateral to secure loan financing for a private entity in which Polese and Peterson were investors, and (2) invested client funds into an investment in which defendants held a financial interest, without informing the client or disclosing their conflict of interest.  Additionally, Polese defrauded two clients through violations of his fiduciary duties to those clients including (1) obtaining a loan from a client on unfavorable terms to the client; and (2) charging a client advisory fees 50% higher than the rate he repeatedly promised to charge her. The Commission\'s complaint alleges that Polese and Peterson violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Polese and Peterson violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and that they aided and abetted violations of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder.

On October 28, 2010, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Massachusetts against BTR and its principals, Ahmet Devrim Akyil and Craig Karlis, alleging that they fraudulently raised millions of dollars from hundreds of investors in a foreign currency ("Forex") trading venture.  Among other things, the Commission alleged that the defendants misappropriated some investor funds for business and personal expenses and lost the vast majority of remaining investor funds through Forex trading activity after falsely promising investors that most of their funds would be protected from such trading losses.  BTR also provided investors with misleading account statements that did not accurately reflect the firm\'s trading activity. After filing, the case was stayed pending the disposition of related criminal prosecutions of Akyil and Karlis brought by the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney.  Karlis pleaded guilty in March 2014 to nine counts of wire fraud, among other charges.  In September 2014, Karlis was sentenced to nine years in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $4,378,356 in restitution to the fraud victims. In the SEC\'s action, Karlis, formerly of Hopkinton, Massachusetts, consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Lunn for his role in a fraudulent investment scheme that operated under the name of Dresdner Financial, a fictitious financial services company purportedly based in Chicago, Illinois. The SEC\'s complaint alleged that between February 2010 and February 2011, Lunn posed as the Vice-President of Dresdner Financial and misappropriated more than $5 million from at least 70 investors located throughout the United States and several foreign countries by promising 100% guaranteed investment returns.  In reality, Dresdner Financial was an elaborate hoax and Lunn did not invest any of the funds.  He instead gave $848,500 to three Las Vegas call girls, withdrew over $1 million in cash and money transfers, made a $1 million Ponzi-like payment to a favored investor, paid over $1.3 million to individuals who helped market the fraudulent scheme, and used the remaining funds to pay for personal and business expenses. The Final Judgment permanently enjoins Lunn from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"); and Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Todd M. LaVelle, the former chief executive officer and a board member of In Home Medical Solutions, LLC (IHMS) and Ara Chackerian, a former officer and board member of IHMS, both learned of an impending merger between Emeritus and Brookdale Senior Living Inc. from IHMS' Chief Operating Officer.  The merger potentially had significant business implications for IHMS because a subsidiary of Emeritus was IHMS' largest customer.  Before the merger was publicly announced, LaVelle and Chackerian bought Emeritus securities and each sold them for illegal profits of over $25,000 and $157,000, respectively, the day after the merger announcement. The SEC's complaint against LaVelle, filed on February 8, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charges him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

For example, Batchelor allegedly used nearly a quarter-million dollars in investor funds to purchase new vehicles and approximately $225,000 to pay student loans.  Batchelor also allegedly transferred thousands of dollars in investor funds to other family members.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on February 8, 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Brian S. Block, the former CFO of American Realty Capital Properties Inc. (ARCP), a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) now known as VEREIT, Inc. On September 8, 2016, the SEC charged Block with overstating the financial performance of ARCP by purposely inflating a key metric used by analysts and investors to assess the company. The SEC's complaint alleged that Block and then-chief accounting officer Lisa P. McAlister devised a scheme to manipulate the calculation of ARCP's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), a non-GAAP measure used when the company provided earnings guidance. After warnings from internal accounting staff that an incorrect method was used to calculate AFFO in ARCP's 2014 first quarter financial results, Block falsified the company's AFFO presentation in the final hours before filing the company's second quarter results.  With McAlister in his office, Block entered fake numbers that concealed the first quarter overstatement of AFFO and made it appear that the company had met second quarter estimates when, in fact, it had fallen short. The SEC's complaint charged Block and McAlister with violating or aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 as well as aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11, and 13a-13.  Block also was charged with violating Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. On the same day the SEC filed its complaint, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Block and McAlister based on the same conduct.  A jury later convicted Block of fraud and related charges and he was subsequently sentenced to eighteen months' incarceration and a $100,000 fine.  McAlister pled guilty to securities fraud and related charges, and she later consented to a final judgment in the SEC's case as well as to an SEC order suspending her from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. Block consented to entry of the final judgment in the SEC's action, which imposed full injunctive relief, a $160,000 civil penalty, and a permanent officer and director bar.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained final judgments against a Ridgefield, Connecticut-based hedge fund manager and his investment advisory businesses.  The federal court in Connecticut ordered the defendants to pay nearly $13 million in disgorgement and penalties after the court had previously determined that the defendants had illegally diverted investor money for use by other hedge funds that were illiquid and in need of cash. The court earlier found Stephen Hicks and the businesses liable on the SEC's claim that they misappropriated investor funds.  The SEC alleged that investors were defrauded because they were not told about the transfers of hedge fund assets while they were taking place.  According to the SEC's complaint, Hicks sent a letter to investors admitting that legal and administrative expenses had been improperly allocated between funds, but rather than repaying the money, he transferred illiquid securities to the funds. The February 10th judgments against Stephen Hicks, Southridge Capital Management LLC, and Southridge Advisors LLC incorporated the Partial Final Judgment issued by the District Court on August 2, 2017.  The Final Judgment enjoined the Southridge entities and Hicks from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Section 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and required them to pay $7,864,064 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest that was previously ordered.  Hicks also must pay a $5 million penalty. The additional claims resolved by the final judgments involved accusations that Hicks fraudulently misstated the value of the fund's largest investment to artificially inflate the management fees Defendants collected from investors.  This settlement also resolves allegations that Hicks fraudulently solicited investors by telling them that the majority of their investments would be placed in unrestricted, free-trading shares (meaning shares that were available to be sold), cash, or near cash.  According to the complaint, Hicks instead invested large portions of the solicited money in relatively illiquid deals.  The defendants consented to the entry of the final judgments, and neither admit nor deny the allegations in the SEC's complaint. For further information, please refer to Litigation Release Nos.

["On February 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgment against relief defendant Shawnet Thibeault in an SEC enforcement action.  The complaint, which the Commission filed in January 2015, charged investment adviser Daniel Thibeault and others with fraud for misappropriating money from an investment fund.  The complaint named Mr. Thibeault's wife, Shawnet Thibeault, as a relief defendant.  According to the complaint, she received some of the money that had been misappropriated from investors.  The judgment entered against Shawnet Thibeault orders her to disgorge over $500,000. According to the complaint, Mr. Thibeault misappropriated money from an investment fund that he was managing.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that Mr. Thibeault and his companies were the investment advisers to the GL Beyond Income Fund, and that they misappropriated at least $15 million of the Fund's money.  According to the complaint, Mr. Thibeault represented that investors' money would be pooled and used to make or purchase consumer loans.  These consumer loans would then constitute the Fund's assets, and would provide a return to the investors when interest and principal payments were made on the loans.  The complaint alleged that Mr. Thibeault and the other defendants (not including Shawnet Thibeault) engaged in a scheme to create fictitious loans to steal money from the Fund, and to report those fake loans as assets of the Fund.  Mr. Thibeault and the other defendants designed this scheme to conceal their misappropriation of millions of dollars from the Fund. The final judgment against Shawnet Thibeault orders her to pay disgorgement of $468,236, representing money she received as a result of the violations alleged in the Complaint, along with prejudgment interest of $49,826, for a total of $518,062.  These funds will be added to the restitution fund in Daniel Thibeault's related criminal case, United States v. Daniel Thibeault, Crim. No. 15-cr-10031-LTS (D.

["On January 10, 2018 and February 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments against Jamie Meadows and Eric McPhail, respectively, defendants in an SEC enforcement action filed in July 2014 alleging that McPhail, Meadows and others committed insider trading in the stock of Massachusetts-based American Superconductor Corp.  The SEC has now obtained final judgments against all of the defendants in this case, and has obtained orders for full disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains against the traders. The SEC's complaint, filed on July 11, 2014, alleged that McPhail repeatedly provided non-public information about American Superconductor to six of his friends, including Meadows.  McPhail's source of inside information was an American Superconductor executive who belonged to the same country club as McPhail and was a close friend.  According to the complaint, from July 2009 through April 2011, the executive told McPhail about American Superconductor's expected earnings, contracts, and other major pending corporate developments, trusting that McPhail would keep the information confidential, while McPhail instead misappropriated the inside information and tipped his friends, including Meadows, who improperly traded on the information.  The SEC's complaint alleged that the six traders profited by a total of over $554,000 through their illegal insider trading. The judgment against McPhail, to which he consented, enjoined him from committing future violations of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws.  In June 2015, McPhail was convicted after a jury trial in a related criminal insider trading action brought by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, and in September 2015 he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and two years of supervised release.  The judgement against Meadows enjoined him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered him to pay full disgorgement of $191,521 plus prejudgment interest of $41,841, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $191,521.  Meadows had consented to a judgment with the injunction and disgorgement and interest amounts, and the court determined the amount of the penalty after a hearing. The five other defendants have previously settled the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act, paying full disgorgement and civil penalties.

['Litigation Release No. 24054 /February 21, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Orange County-based Strong Investment Management and its president and sole owner, Joseph B. Bronson, for operating a "cherry picking" scheme that defrauded Strong\'s clients.  The complaint also alleges that John B. Engebretson, Bronson\'s brother and the former chief compliance officer of Strong, abdicated his compliance responsibilities and ignored numerous "red flags" raised during the course of the fraudulent scheme. The complaint alleges that for more than four years, Bronson traded securities in Strong\'s omnibus account but delayed allocating the securities to specific client accounts until he had observed the securities\' performance over the course of the day.  Bronson reaped substantial profits at his clients\' expense by "cherry picking" the trades, allocating the profitable trades to himself and the unprofitable trades to Strong\'s clients.  The complaint also alleges that Strong and Bronson misrepresented their trading and allocation practices in the firm\'s Forms ADV, including by falsely stating that all trades would be allocated in accordance with pre-trade allocation statements and that the firm did not favor any account, including those of the firm\'s personnel. The SEC also alleges that Engebretson failed in his role as chief compliance officer to ensure that Strong\'s policies and procedures regarding trade allocations were implemented and repeatedly disregarded "red flags" relating to Strong\'s allocation practices. The SEC\'s complaint charges Bronson and Strong Investment Management with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\xa0  It also alleges that Strong Investment Management violated Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder and that Bronson and Engebretson aided and abetted those violations. This is the third action arising out of an enforcement initiative to combat cherry-picking led by the SEC\'s Los Angeles Regional Office and supported by the agency\'s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA).  The previous actions   on September 12, 2017.  The SEC\'s investigation was conducted by Colleen Keating and supervised by Robert Conrrad, with assistance from Scott Walster and Raymond Wolff in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a settled action in federal court against the perpetrators of a multi-million dollar fraudulent offering of unregistered securities for a Southern California-based home audio manufacturer. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Dedicated Sound and Audio, Inc. ("DSA"), located in Lake Forest, California, and Steven Ventre, its founder, president, and CEO, retained the services of Choice Equity, a telemarketer controlled by recidivist Eric Lovy (formerly known as Eric Beltran), to solicit investors on DSA\'s behalf.  The SEC alleges that investors in the unregistered offering were falsely told in a private placement memorandum drafted by Ventre and Lovy that DSA would pay no more than 15% of the amount raised in sales commissions to registered broker-dealers.  In reality, over a 20-month span, DSA paid more than 33% ($1.56 million of $4.6 million) of the amount raised to Choice Equity and Lovy, neither of whom is registered with the SEC.  More than half of the commissions went directly to Lovy. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges DSA and Ventre with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, in the alternative, charges Ventre with liability as a control person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for DSA\'s liability under Section 10(b).  The complaint further charges Lovy with aiding and abetting DSA\'s and Ventre\'s violations of these antifraud provisions.  In addition, the SEC charges all of the defendants with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and both Lovy and Choice Equity with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws; imposing civil penalties against each of them; and ordering Lovy and Choice Equity to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest of the collective $1.56 million in commissions that they received from DSA, and civil penalties of $160,000 and $870,850, respectively.  DSA and Ventre agreed to pay penalties of $250,000 and $80,000, respectively.

["A former Merck & Co. Inc. employee who bought stock in a company that Merck was preparing to acquire in a tender offer agreed to pay a penalty equal to three times his illegal insider trading profits to settle an action by the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the SEC's complaint, on November 20, 2014 at 4:04 p.m., Yang Xie, then-Director of Global Health Outcomes Research for Merck, received an email from a Merck attorney discussing a contemplated merger between Merck and Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  The email included an attachment advising recipients not to trade in Cubist's stock until a full trading date had elapsed after a public announcement of the acquisition.  The complaint alleges that, approximately six minutes later, Xie replied to the e-mail and acknowledged receiving it.  Approximately 14 minutes after he received the Merck attorney's email, Xie bought 80 shares of Cubist stock.  On January 21, 2015, the date the tender offer was completed, Xie sold his Cubist stock and realized illegal profits of approximately 39%.  During the SEC's investigation that followed, Xie allegedly denied learning about Merck's proposed acquisition of Cubist until the night before it was publicly announced. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, charges Xie with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 and Exchange Act Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-3.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against Canadian-based penny stock company Analytica Bio-Energy Corp., a shareholder controlling its affairs, and a former officer for filing false reports with the SEC and for the controlling shareholder\'s fraudulent scheme to sell unregistered shares to the public.  In a related matter, the SEC also filed an application seeking a court order requiring Analytica\'s accountant, Marvin Winick, to comply with an SEC suspension order from 2006. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that from 2013 to 2014, Douglas Murdock, who was an undisclosed control person of Analytica, orchestrated a scheme to fraudulently procure Analytica shares and sell them in unregistered transactions.  Murdock also fraudulently induced Analytica\'s transfer agent to remove the restrictive legend from company shares.  While Murdock conducted this scheme, he and Luiz Brasil, Analytica\'s former President, substantially assisted Analytica\'s filing of numerous misleading periodic reports with the SEC. The SEC\'s complaint charges Analytica and Murdock with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and charges Murdock and Brasil with aiding and abetting those violations.  Murdock is also charged with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(1), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC\'s allegations, Murdock and Brasil agreed to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged sections of the federal securities laws; imposing penny stock bars and officer-and-director bars; and providing that, upon the SEC\'s motion, the court shall determine whether it is appropriate to order disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and/or a civil penalty. In a related matter, the SEC filed an application seeking an order requiring Canadian accountant Marvin Winick to comply with a 2006 SEC order that suspended Winick from appearing or practicing before the Commission.  According to the SEC\'s application, Winick violated the SEC\'s 2006 suspension order by preparing and consolidating financial statements that were included in periodic reports that Analytica filed with the Commission in 2013 and 2014.  Winick has consented to the entry of a court order enforcing the SEC\'s 2006 suspension order. These actions are subject to Court approval. The Commission also announced today the temporary suspension, for ten business days, of trading in the securities of Analytica. The SEC\'s investigation was conducted by Michael Brennan and was supervised by Antonia Chion, Melissa Hodgman, and Kevin Guerrero.

['Litigation Release No.  24060 / March 1, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three-time recidivist Steven J. Muehler with operating an unregistered broker-dealer, facilitating an unregistered securities offering, and defrauding small businesses, while promising to help them raise money from investors.  Three companies under Muehler\'s control, Muehler\'s wife, Claudia M. Muehler, and his associate, Koorosh "Danny" Rahimi, were also charged.  Because the scheme is ongoing, the SEC is also seeking a preliminary injunction to stop Muehler\'s ongoing violations of the securities laws, pending trial of the action. The SEC\'s complaint, which was filed in federal court in Los Angeles, also charges Muehler with violating a cease-and-desist order issued by the Commission in 2016 barring Muehler from associating with any broker-dealer.  The SEC has filed a parallel action in the same court to enforce that Commission order. According to the complaint, Muehler\'s companies are not registered as broker-dealers.  But since at least November 2015, Muehler and his companies have nonetheless agreed to provide broker-dealer services to more than 20 small businesses, including identifying and soliciting investors and utilizing a purportedly proprietary online securities exchange to help raise funds from investors.  In return, Muehler and his companies received fees, the right to a percentage of any funds raised from investors, and the right to an equity stake in each small business customer. The SEC also alleges that in offering broker-dealer services, Muehler and his companies made numerous fraudulent claims to potential customers, including that Muehler and his companies had $50 million on-hand to invest in their customers\' securities, that they had previously helped customers raise millions of dollars, and that their proprietary online exchange was registered with the SEC.  They also concealed that Muehler is subject to a Commission cease-and-desist order and has been sanctioned by California and Minnesota securities regulators. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Claudia Muehler and Danny Rahimi helped Muehler carry out this scheme. The SEC\'s complaint charges Muehler and the three companies he controls (AltaVista Capital Markets, LLC, AltaVista Private Client, LLC, and AltaVista Securities, LLC) with violating Section 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a), Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and also charges Muehler with violating Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  It charges Claudia Muehler with aiding and abetting Muehler\'s and the AltaVista Companies\' violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and charges Rahimi with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

["On March 9, 2018, Judge Katherine B. Forrest of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York sentenced Robert W. Murray, a defendant in a pending SEC litigation, to two years imprisonment in connection with a scheme to manipulate Fitbit securities through false filings on the SEC's EDGAR system.  Murray pled guilty on November 7, 2017. The criminal charges against Murray arose from the same conduct alleged in the complaint the SEC filed on May 19, 2017, the same day the criminal charges were announced.  According to the SEC's complaint, Murray allegedly purchased Fitbit call options just minutes before a fake tender offer that he orchestrated was filed on the SEC's EDGAR system purporting that a sham company sought to acquire Fitbit's outstanding shares at a substantial premium.  Fitbit's stock price temporarily spiked when the tender offer became publicly available on Nov. 10, 2016, and Murray sold all of his options for a profit of approximately $3,100.  Murray took steps to conceal his identity and actual location, including using an alias to create an email account and using an IP address registered to a company located in another state. The SEC's action was stayed pending the outcome of the criminal case.

As a result of the settlement, Defendants will be ordered to return all ill-gotten funds to investors. The SEC alleges that from 2012 through 2016, Tobias Preston, his brother, Charles Preston, and his son, Caleb Preston, along with their investment advisory entity, McKinley Mortgage Co. LLC (McKinley), raised more than $66 million from approximately 300 investors, most of whom were retail investors, by falsely stating that investments in their fund, Alaska Financial Company III, LLC (AFC III), were secure and that AFC III earned high returns from its portfolio.  In reality, AFC III has been insolvent and unable to generate sufficient revenue to meet its interest obligations for years.  According to the SEC, although a portion of the raised funds were invested as promised to investors, Tobias Preston misused more than $17 million to fund personal businesses and to pay for personal expenses, and McKinley misused an additional $14 million to pay for its own operational expenses.  The SEC also alleges that Charles Preston, Caleb Preston, and Accounting Manager Laura Sanford helped hide the fraud by preparing or distributing investor materials with false information and concealing information from AFC III's auditors. The SEC's complaint charges violations of the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, all defendants agreed to permanent injunctions against future violations.  McKinley Mortgage Co.

Based on investor complaints, the SEC moved quickly to investigate and charge Shah.  According to the SEC's Complaint, unsealed on March 22, 2018 in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, Shah used Spark Trading Group, LLC to defraud more than 15 investors into contributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to two funds that Shah marketed.  Shah obtained investments for the funds by lying about his success as a trader, Spark Trading's returns, and how he intended to use investors' money, including altering financial statements to make the funds appear profitable when they were actually losing money.  For instance the Complaint alleges that Shah promised investors he would pay them monthly returns and guaranteed against losses.  According to the Complaint, Shah misused investor money for his own benefit and suffered substantial losses on the amounts actually invested.  When investors sought their money back, he lied and said the money had been frozen by government agencies, including the Commission. The SEC's Complaint charges Spark Trading and Shah with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Akorn, Dick and Hebeda agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations. According to the Commission's complaint, in May 2016, Akorn restated its financial statements for fiscal year 2014 acknowledging material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related, in relevant part, to controls surrounding the company's gross-to-net reserve accounts and estimates.  In its restatement, the company also disclosed that it overstated net revenue for 2014 by approximately 7 percent and income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2014 by approximately 136 percent.  Akorn's material weaknesses persisted over multiple reporting periods and contributed to Akorn's materially inaccurate 2014 financial statements. The complaint also alleges that in 2014, Dick, as CFO, and Hebeda, as Controller, had supervisory responsibilities for Akorn's internal accounting controls, gross-to-net revenue accounting and revenue recognition, and exercised control over these company functions.

["On October 17, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged mining company Rio Tinto and two former top executives with fraud for inflating the value of coal assets acquired for $3.7 billion and sold a few years later for $50 million. The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Rio Tinto, its former CEO Thomas Albanese, and its former CFO Guy Elliott failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record its assets.\xa0 Instead, as the project began to suffer one setback after another resulting in the rapid decline of the value of the coal assets, they sought to hide or delay disclosure of the nature and extent of the adverse developments from Rio Tinto's Board of Directors, Audit Committee, independent auditors, and investors. Based on the complaint's allegations, Rio Tinto plc, Rio Tinto Limited, Albanese, and Elliott are charged with violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.\xa0 The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and civil penalties from all the defendants, and seeks to bar Albanese and Elliott from serving as public company officers or directors. According to the SEC's complaint, in 2011, Rio Tinto acquired coal assets in Mozambique shortly after disclosing huge losses associated with its previous large-scale acquisition of Alcan.\xa0 Both acquisitions took place under Albanese's leadership.\xa0 The second acquisition was also unsuccessful as it was based on the incorrect assumption that Rio Tinto could inexpensively mine, transport, and sell large quantities of high-quality coal, chiefly using barges for shipping.\xa0 The SEC's complaint alleges that the project suffered setbacks almost immediately, as Rio Tinto, Albanese, and Elliott learned that there was less coal and of lower quality than expected, and that Mozambique had rejected its barge application. The complaint alleges that the drop in quantity and quality of coal, coupled with the lack of infrastructure to transport it, significantly eroded the value of the acquisition. The complaint alleges that after already impairing Alcan twice, Rio Tinto, Albanese, and Elliott knew that publicly disclosing its second failure and rapidly declining value would call into question their ability to pursue the core of Rio Tinto's business model to identify and develop long-term, low-cost, and highly-profitable mining assets.\xa0 Instead, they concealed the adverse developments, allowing Rio Tinto to release misleading financial statements days before a series of U.S. debt offerings.\xa0 Rio Tinto raised $5.5 billion from U.S. investors, approximately $3 billion of which was raised after May 2012, when executives at Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique had already told Albanese and Elliott that the subsidiary was likely worth negative $680 million.\xa0 The complaint alleges Albanese then repeated and reinforced the false positive outlook for the project in public statements. The alleged fraud continued until January 2013, when an executive in Rio Tinto's Technology & Innovation Group discovered that the coal assets were being carried at an inflated value on Rio Tinto's financial statements.\xa0 After an internal review allegedly triggered by the executive's report to Rio Tinto's Chairman, Rio Tinto announced that Albanese had resigned and the company reduced the value of the coal assets by more than $3 billion, or more than 80 percent.\xa0 After a second reduction, Rio Tinto sold the Mozambique subsidiary for $50 million, billions of dollars below the acquisition price. The SEC's investigation was conducted by D. Mark Cave, Jeffrey Weiss, and George Spanos and supervised by Melissa Hodgman.\xa0 The SEC's litigation will be conducted by Mr. Cave, Dean M.

['Litigation Release No. 24089 / March 30, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged the pastor of one of the largest Protestant churches in the country and a self-described financial planner in a scheme to defraud elderly investors by selling them interests in defunct, pre-Revolutionary Chinese bonds. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that, in 2013 and 2014, Kirbyjon Caldwell, Senior Pastor at Windsor Village United Methodist Church in Houston, and Gregory Alan Smith, a self-described financial planner who FINRA has barred from the broker-dealer business since 2010, targeted vulnerable and elderly investors with false assurances that the bonds-collectible memorabilia with no meaningful investment value-were worth millions of dollars.  Caldwell and Smith raised at least $3.4 million from 29 mostly elderly investors, some of whom liquidated their annuities to invest in this scheme.  Caldwell and Smith are alleged to have taken approximately $1.8 million of investor funds to pay for personal expenses, including mortgage payments in the case of Caldwell and luxury automobiles in the case of Smith.  Offshore individuals received most of the remaining funds. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Caldwell and Smith violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Smith violated Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Commission\'s complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement with prejudgment interest against Caldwell and Smith, and an officer and director bar against Caldwell. In a separate complaint the SEC charged attorney Shae Yatta Harper of Monmouth Junction, New Jersey, with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and aiding and abetting Caldwell\'s and Smith\'s violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder..  Harper agreed to settle the SEC\'s complaint against her without admitting or denying the SEC\'s allegations.  Among other things, Harper agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty and to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commission\'s Rules of Practice that suspends her from appearing or practicing as an attorney before the Commission with the right to request that the Commission consider her reinstatement after five years. The SEC\'s investigation was conducted by Jacqueline M. O\'Reilly and Andre J. Zamorano, with assistance from Allen J. Genaldi, and supervised by Thierry Olivier Desmet in the SEC\'s Miami Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Wilfredo Fernandez.']

["The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged St. Petersburg, Florida resident Gregory M. Bercowy with a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the stock price of Aureus, Inc., a penny stock company incorporated in Nevada. The SEC alleges that between August 4 and August 15, 2016, Bercowy, who is associated with a state-registered investment adviser, sold shares of certain Fortune 500 companies, including Abbott and Apple, in his relative's brokerage account in order to buy over three million shares of Aureus at a total cost of more than $2.8 million.  According to the SEC's complaint, while Bercowy was accumulating these shares of Aureus, he entered (and later cancelled) a large number of orders to buy Aureus shares at prices higher than the then-current price of the stock. The orders allegedly were intended solely to maintain or boost the stock's price.  The price per share of Aureus securities increased from $0.52 on August 4, 2016, to $1.62 on August 16, 2016.  According to the SEC's complaint, Bercowy stated in recorded phone calls with a representative of a brokerage firm that he and others were trying to boost Aureus's stock price. The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charges Bercowy with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Michael Liberty, the founder of the fintech startup now known as Mozido, Inc., with a fraudulent scheme to trick hundreds of investors into investing in his shell companies instead of Mozido.  Michael Liberty and his accomplices then stole most of the more than $48 million raised to fund a lavish lifestyle that included private jet flights, multi-million dollar residences, expensive cars, and movie production ventures. The SEC\'s complaint, filed March 30, 2018, alleges that Michael Liberty, his wife, Brittany Liberty, his cousin, Richard Liberty, Paul Hess, and attorney George Marcus induced investors to purchase unregistered interests in shell companies controlled by Michael Liberty that supposedly owned transferrable interests in Mozido.  In reality, the shell companies either did not own, or were not permitted to transfer, interests in the company.  The SEC also alleges that Michael Liberty and his accomplices lied to investors about Mozido\'s valuation and finances, the amount Michael Liberty had personally invested in Mozido, and the use of their funds.  According to the complaint, Michael Liberty and his accomplices later orchestrated a series of transactions in which they used investors\' own money to heavily dilute their interests and duped investors into trading securities for those worth more than 90% less. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in federal court in Maine, charges Defendants with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Michael Liberty; Brittany Abbass Liberty ("Abbass"); Richard Liberty; Hess; Marcus; Brentwood Financial, LLC ("Brentwood Financial"); BRTMDO Investments, LLC ("BRTMDO"); Family Mobile, LLC ("Family Mobile"); and Mozido Invesco, LLC ("Mozido Invesco") violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act")  and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, in the alternative Abbass, Richard Liberty, Hess, Marcus, Brentwood Financial, BRTMDO, Family Mobile, and Mozido Invesco aided and abetted those violations.

['Litigation Release No. 24094 / April 4, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Westchester, New York-based investment adviser with fraud stemming from lies to retail investors about the value of their investments in a Ponzi-like scheme. The SEC alleges that, starting in approximately 2010, Michael Scronic began to raise money from at least 42 friends and acquaintances, many of whom were from his suburban community, in order to invest in a risky options trading strategy.  He allegedly lured investors by informing them that he had a long and impressive track record of proven returns.  He also allegedly lied to investors about the liquidity of investments, telling one investor that "what\'s cool about my fund is that i\'m [sic] only in publicly traded options and cash so any redemptions are met within 2 business days so if you do need to withdraw for your business needs it will be quick and painless."  However, the SEC alleges that Scronic was actually hemorrhaging investor money through massive trading losses, with at least $15 million in investment losses since April 2010.  For the period ending June 30, 2017, Scronic allegedly reported to investors total assets of at least $21,837,475.  However, the balance in his brokerage account on June 30, 2017 was just under $27,500. According to the SEC\'s complaint, when certain investors attempted to redeem their investments, Scronic did not disclose his inability to repay them. Rather, he allegedly provided investors with a steady stream of implausible excuses for why he could not pay them back. In other instances, Scronic sought to obtain additional investment funds from new and existing investors in order to satisfy redemption requests from other investors.  The SEC also alleges that Scronic began identifying himself as an investment adviser to a fictitious hedge fund in which he purported to sell interests, or "shares." In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Scronic. The SEC\'s complaint charges Scronic with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

["On September 29, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former executive at Life Time Fitness Inc., a middleman tipper, and six traders with insider trading ahead of the announcement that the company would be purchased and taken private. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, the SEC alleges that Shane P. Fleming, a former vice president of sales at Life Time Fitness, learned of the merger discussions on or before Feb. 23, 2015 and tipped his friend and business partner Bret J. Beshey with the understanding that Beshey would use the information to make a profit and split those profits with Fleming.  The SEC alleges that rather than trade in his own name, Beshey tipped his friends Christopher M. Bonvissuto and Peter A. Kourtis with the understanding that both men would kick back a portion of their trading proceeds to Beshey.  According to the SEC's complaint, Kourtis tipped his friends Alexander T. Carlucci, Dimitri A. Kandalepas, Austin C. Mansur, and Eric L. Weller, and asked Carlucci, Mansur, and Weller to give him a portion of any profits they made from trading on the information, which they agreed to do. The SEC alleges that the six traders purchased a total of approximately 2,000 highly speculative out-of-the-money call options for Life Time Fitness shares and sold those options for profits of approximately $866,209 shortly after a newspaper reported that Life Time Fitness was in advanced merger discussions with two private equity firms.  According to the SEC's complaint, Bonvissuto and Kourtis shared a portion of their profits with Beshey, who gave approximately $10,000 in cash to Fleming.  The SEC also alleges that Carlucci and Mansur paid cash kickbacks to Kourtis, and that Weller gave Kourtis at least 10 pounds of marijuana as a kickback. The SEC's complaint charges Fleming, Beshey, Bonvissuto, Kourtis, Carlucci, Kandalepas, Mansur, and Weller with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

["April 5, 2018 -- The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Lexington, Massachusetts resident for making an extraordinarily profitable series of unlawful trades in the securities of Massachusetts-based VistaPrint, N.V. According to the SEC's complaint, Charlie Jinan Chen used nonpublic information obtained directly or indirectly from a VistaPrint insider to place illegal trades in advance of eight VistaPrint quarterly earnings announcements over a two-year period.  Each time, Chen's trades were consistent with the news-whether good or bad-in VistaPrint's pending earnings announcements.  On some occasions, Chen placed extremely aggressive bets, wagering a substantial portion of his retirement savings on risky VistaPrint options before the company's announcement of disappointing earnings results in April 2014.  Chen generated approximately $390,000 on the April 2014 trade and more than $900,000 in illicit profits over the course of the scheme. In addition to detailing Chen's uncannily successful pattern of trading, the SEC also alleges that upon being questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Chen claimed that he did not know anyone who worked at VistaPrint and falsely denied having a close relationship with a VistaPrint insider and her husband with whom he had vacationed.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged convicted felon and former NHL team owner Peter H. Pocklington, his medical device company, and others with defrauding investors by hiding Pocklington\'s recidivist history and by misappropriating investor funds. The SEC alleges that in 2010, Pocklington pleaded guilty to a federal felony perjury charge and was later ordered to pay over $5 million as part of a settlement for unrelated state securities fraud and registration charges.  Pocklington subsequently founded and now controls California-based The Eye Machine, LLC (now known as Nova Oculus Partners, LLC), a medical device company that raised over $14 million between 2014 and 2017 from more than 260 investors in unregistered offerings. According to the SEC\'s complaint, Pocklington and his attorney, Lantson E. Eldred, structured the ownership of The Eye Machine to conceal Pocklington\'s role with the company and held Eldred out as the company\'s "visual front."  In the offerings, Pocklington, Eldred, and The Eye Machine allegedly failed to disclose Pocklington\'s checkered history and involvement, and misrepresented how investor funds would be spent.  Pocklington allegedly misappropriated over $600,000 of investor funds for personal use, including funding his gold mining companies and paying personal legal and credit card bills.  The complaint also alleges that The Eye Machine paid millions of dollars in undisclosed and excessive sales commissions to defendants Yolanda C. Velazquez, Vanessa Puleo, and Robert A. Vanetten, who acted as unregistered brokers for the company.  According to the complaint, Velazquez - whom the SEC previously barred from acting as a broker-dealer - and Puleo used "boiler room" operations in Florida to "cold call" investors. The Commission\'s complaint, filed in federal court in California, charges: (i) The Eye Machine, Pocklington, Eldred, Velazquez, Puleo, and Vanetten with violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"); (ii) The Eye Machine, AMC Holdings, Pocklington, and Eldred with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; (iii) Walton with violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act; (iv) The Eye Machine, AMC Holdings, and Pocklington with violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act; (v) The Eye Machine, Pocklington, and Eldred with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; (vi) Pocklington and Eldred with aiding and abetting The Eye Machine\'s primary violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5; (vii) Pocklington as the control person of The Eye Machine under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for The Eye Machine\'s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (viii) Velazquez, Puleo, and Vanetten with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and (ix) Velazquez with violating Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act.

["Joseph Meli has been sentenced by a federal court in Manhattan to more than six years in prison in connection with a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme involving purported resales of tickets to popular concerts and Broadway shows.  The criminal case arises from the same conduct alleged in two Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions filed against Meli in 2017. Meli was arrested in January 2017 and later pleaded guilty to securities fraud.  In connection with his plea, Meli admitted to raising millions of dollars from investors including by providing some investors with fake agreements containing fraudulent signatures that claimed to show Meli's company had agreements with various production and management companies to purchase large blocks of tickets.  On April 3, 2018, a federal court sentenced Meli to 78 months' imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay forfeiture in the amount of $104,765,565 and restitution in an amount to be finalized at a later date. In 2017, the SEC filed two enforcement actions against Meli in federal district court in Manhattan.  In the first action, the SEC alleged that Meli and his co-defendants solicited investments for the bulk purchase and resale of tickets to popular Broadway shows and concerts, but used the majority of the more than $97 million raised to make payments to earlier investors and to enrich Meli, his family, and a co-defendant.  On April 26, 2017, the court entered a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against Meli and his co-defendants in that matter.  In the second action, the SEC alleged that Meli and New York sports radio personality Craig Carton raised millions from investors by falsely claiming that they had access to large blocks of face-value tickets to popular concert performances.  Instead of purchasing tickets for resale, Carton and Meli allegedly misappropriated at least $3.6 million to repay earlier investors and to cover other expenses, including Carton's gambling debts.  Both SEC actions charge Meli and his co-defendants with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

['SEC Charges New York Man with Insider Trading']
['Litigation Release No. 24104 / April 5, 2018']
['On April 5, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New York resident with tipping his brother and father with material nonpublic information about an upcoming corporate acquisition. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that, in 2014, Saverio J. Barbera ("Barbera"), learned that Owens & Minor, Inc., a Virginia-based healthcare logistics company, was going to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Medical Action Industries, Inc. ("Medical Action"), a Brentwood, New York, medical products supplier.  According to the complaint, Barbera then told his father and brother that they should purchase Medical Action stock in advance of the acquisition so that they could profit from the deal.  The SEC alleges that Barbera obtained the information that he tipped to his father and brother from his close friend, the Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Medical Action.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, soon after receiving this tip and less than a week before the public announcement of the deal, Barbera\'s father and brother purchased a combined total of 22,000 shares of Medical Action common stock, which they then sold at a profit following the deal\'s announcement.  The SEC alleges that, as a result of their trading, Barbera\'s father and brother realized combined trading profits of approximately $145,000. Barbera has agreed to settle the SEC\'s charges by paying a penalty of $289,650.72, an amount which is twice the trading profits of his father and brother.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\'s allegations, Barbera has also agreed to the entry of a final judgment that enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC\'s investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John O\'Halloran and H.B.

['SEC Obtains Emergency Freeze of $27 Million in Stock Sales of Purported Cryptocurrency Company Longfin']
['Litigation Release No. 24106 / April 9, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission has obtained a court order freezing more than $27 million in trading proceeds from allegedly illegal distributions and sales of restricted shares of Longfin Corp. stock involving the company, its CEO, and three other affiliated individuals. According to a   unsealed on April 6, 2018 in federal court in Manhattan, shortly after Longfin began trading on NASDAQ and announced the acquisition of a purported cryptocurrency business, its stock price rose dramatically and its market capitalization exceeded $3 billion. The SEC alleges that Amro Izzelden "Andy" Altahawi, Dorababu Penumarthi, and Suresh Tammineedi then illegally sold large blocks of their restricted Longfin shares to the public while the stock price was highly elevated. Through their sales, Altahawi, Penumarthi, and Tammineedi collectively reaped more than $27 million in profits. According to the SEC\'s complaint, Longfin\'s founding CEO and controlling shareholder, Venkata Meenavalli, caused the company to issue more than two million unregistered, restricted shares to Altahawi, who was the corporate secretary and a director of Longfin, and tens of thousands of restricted shares to two other affiliated individuals, Penumarthi and Tammineedi, who were allegedly acting as nominees for Meenavalli. The subsequent sales of those restricted shares violated federal securities laws that restrict trading in unregistered shares distributed to company affiliates. The SEC\'s complaint, which was filed under seal on April 4, charges Longfin, Meenavalli, Altahawi, Penumarthi, and Tammineedi with violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and penalties, among other relief.

['On April 6, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two Texas companies and their principals in a $2.4 million Ponzi scheme and in a related, $1.4 million offering fraud targeting retirees. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that, from 2010 to 2017, Clifton E. Stanley ran a Ponzi scheme through his retirement planning and real estate investment business, The Lifepay Group, LLC.  Stanley is alleged to have lured at least thirty elderly victims to invest approximately $2.4 million of their retirement savings with baseless promises and claims of outsized investment returns.  He kept the scheme afloat for years by paying early investors with later investors\' funds and by convincing investors to roll over their investments.  The SEC further alleges that Stanley pilfered from the estate of an elderly woman\'s family trust, diverting nearly $100,000 to fund the Lifepay Ponzi scheme.  In addition, the SEC\'s complaint alleges that, beginning in 2015, Stanley and Michael E. Watts orchestrated a second offering fraud through a company they controlled, SMDRE, LLC.  Stanley and Watts allegedly used a collection of misrepresentations and empty promises to convince a group of predominantly elderly victims to invest roughly $1.4 million in SMDRE. Stanley is alleged to have used roughly $1.3 million of the Lifepay offering proceeds for personal expenses, including country club memberships, daily living expenses, travel, and entertainment expenses.  In addition, Watts and Stanley allegedly engaged in shell game transactions so they could use the vast majority of SMDRE investor funds for personal expenses and to keep the Lifepay Ponzi scheme afloat. The SEC\'s complaint charges Stanley, Watts, Lifepay, and SMDRE with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.

['SEC Detects Brokers Defrauding Customers']
['Litigation Release No. 24108 / April 11, 2018']
["On September 28, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged three New York-based brokers with making unsuitable recommendations that resulted in substantial losses to customers and hefty commissions for the brokers.  One of the brokers agreed to pay more than $400,000 to settle the charges. Brokers must make recommendations that are compatible with their customers' financial needs, investment objectives, and risk tolerances.  An SEC examination of the firm Alexander Capital L.P. detected potential misconduct among certain brokers, and the ensuing investigation has led to the filing of an SEC complaint against William C. Gennity and Rocco Roveccio.  The SEC also issued an order against Laurence M. Torres. The SEC's complaint alleges that Gennity and Roveccio recommended investments that involved frequent buying and selling of securities without any reasonable basis to believe their customers would profit.  According to the complaint, since customers incur costs with every transaction, the price of the security must increase significantly during the brief period it is held in an account for even a minimal profit to be realized. The SEC further alleges that Gennity and Roveccio churned customer accounts, engaged in unauthorized trading, and concealed material information from their customers - namely that the transaction costs associated with their recommendations (commissions, markups, markdowns, postage, fees, and margin interest) would almost certainly outstrip any potential monetary gains in the accounts.  According to the SEC's complaint, customer losses totaled $683,038 while Gennity and Roveccio received approximately $280,000 and $206,000, respectively, in commissions and fees. The SEC's order against Torres finds that he had no reasonable basis to believe it was suitable to recommend a high-cost pattern of frequent trading that gave his customers virtually no chance of making even a minimal profit.  Torres also engaged in churning and made unauthorized trades.  Without admitting or denying the findings, Torres agreed to be barred from the securities industry and penny stock trading, and he must pay $225,359.36 in disgorgement plus $25,748.02 in interest, and a $160,000 penalty. The SEC's litigation against Gennity and Roveccio will proceed in federal district court in Manhattan, with the complaint charging them with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

Khalfani and hid his past criminal convictions, with raising nearly $2 million through his firm Capital Cove Bancorp LLC for purported investments in two private funds that invested in distressed real estate.  Khalfani allegedly enticed investors by falsely boasting that REO Opportunities Fund II LLC and Rittenhouse Square Trust LLC were "vetted, qualified, and registered" with the SEC and several other government agencies.  Khalfani allegedly stole investor money from both funds, and in some instances used it to purchase his own real estate. The SEC obtained an emergency asset freeze to stop the alleged fraud and prevent further investor losses, and the court appointed a receiver.  The SEC obtained a default judgment against Capital Cove and, in 2016, obtained summary judgment against Khalfani.

The SEC\'s complaint alleged that the brokers misrepresented the CMOs to their customers as safe, secure, liquid investments that guaranteed by the United States government and suitable for retirees, retirement accounts, and investors with conservative investment goals.  In fact, according to the complaint, many of the CMOs purchased for Brookstreet customer accounts carried no government backing, were largely illiquid, and were only suitable for sophisticated investors with a high-risk investment profile. The court ruled in the SEC\'s favor against two of the brokers, William Betta, Jr. and Travis A. Branch, and issued an injunction permanently restraining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\xa0 The court declined to impose civil penalties, but retained jurisdiction to conduct further proceedings to determine the amount of disgorgement against Betta and Branch.\xa0 The court also issued final judgments in favor of defendants Troy L.

['Litigation Release No. 24121 / April 24, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a biotech start-up formerly based in Massachusetts, its CEO, and another employee with lying about their progress in seeking FDA approval for a non-opiate pain treatment and with lying about the company\'s finances. The SEC also alleges that the insiders along with the CEO\'s close friend manipulated the company\'s publicly trading stock, and the CEO and his friend kept about $400,000 for themselves. As alleged in the SEC\'s complaint, PixarBio Corporation, its founder and CEO Frank Reynolds, and employee Kenneth Stromsland misled investors with false claims about PixarBio\'s progress in developing "NeuroRelease," a purported method of delivering non-opiate, post-operative pain medication. From December 2015 to the present, the defendants are alleged to have falsely told investors that the FDA had lowered PixarBio\'s hurdles for regulatory approval. They are also charged with misleading investors about the amount of money PixarBio had raised and about a phony takeover bid of a company that Reynolds had previously led. According to the complaint, the defendants raised about $12.7 million from about 211 investors in an unregistered offering. The SEC\'s complaint also alleges that from about July 2016 to January 2017, Reynolds, his close friend M. Jay Herod, and Stromsland engaged in a fraudulent scheme to acquire and merge PixarBio with a publicly traded company and to secretly manipulate the sales of shares in the new entity. From these sales, Reynolds and Herod pocketed about $400,000, and they used an additional $500,000 to keep PixarBio afloat as Reynolds misled investors about how much money they had raised in the unregistered offering. The defendants are also charged with violating the registration requirements for securities offerings, while Reynolds and Stromsland are charged with selling securities without being registered as a broker or dealer. Investors can quickly check whether people selling investments are registered by using the  . The SEC charges each of the defendants with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the securities laws, Herod and Stromsland with stock manipulation, and Reynolds and Stromsland with acting as unregistered broker-dealers. The SEC\'s complaint seeks a permanent injunction, the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, a penalty, and industry and penny stock bars. The SEC also seeks a court order to immediately freeze the assets of PixarBio and Reynolds and to prohibit each of the defendants from soliciting money from investors. The U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced parallel criminal charges against Reynolds, Herod, and Stromsland.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action on April 25, 2018, against a lawyer and two other individuals relating to two microcap schemes involving undisclosed "blank check" companies.  In separate, settled administrative proceedings, the SEC charged another individual and two public companies related to one of the schemes. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that attorney Diane J. Harrison, Esq. and her husband, Michael J. Daniels, both of Palmetto, Florida, manufactured at least five microcap issuers with the undisclosed intent to sell them based on their status as public companies with purportedly unrestricted shares available for resale in the public markets.  According to the complaint, Daniels and Harrison created the false appearance that the companies were pursuing specific business plans with independent management and shareholders by installing friends and family (including defendant Catherine A. Bradaick-Zolla of Sarasota, Florida, who also provided other assistance to the fraud) as purported officers and shareholders.  The SEC alleges that, in reality, Daniels and Harrison controlled the shares.  According to the complaint, Daniels and Harrison sold four of the five companies to Andy Z. Fan of Las Vegas, Nevada and, along with Bradaick-Zolla, continued to provide support to Fan.\xa0 For example, the SEC alleges that Daniels, Harrison, and Bradaick-Zolla prepared false SEC filings, Harrison submitted false legal opinion letters, and Daniels and Bradaick-Zolla entered manipulative trades to artificially set the price of the stocks in the public market.  The SEC previously issued a   on the public offering of the fifth company in Daniels and Harrison\'s pipeline.

Mirman and Sheldon R. Rose.  The SEC previously filed  and  , who were also convicted of criminal charges and sentenced to prison based on the same alleged conduct.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, Harrison provided at least 21 false legal opinion letters in furtherance of Mirman and Rose\'s scheme. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that Harrison and Daniels violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rules 10b-5 and Rule 13a-14 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 13a-14 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Daniels violated Section 9(a) of the Exchange Act, and that Harrison also violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The complaint further alleges that Harrison and Bradaick-Zolla aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and officer-and-director bars against each defendant. In separate orders instituting settled administrative proceedings, the Commission charged Fan and two public companies under his control, AF Ocean Investment Management Company and ChinAmerica Andy Movie Entertainment Media Company, with issuing false press releases and making false SEC filings regarding their purported revenues.  The Commission also charged Fan with manipulating the price of both companies\' stock and fraudulently selling his controlling interest in another public company. Without admitting or denying the SEC\'s findings, Fan and the two companies agreed to the entry of cease-and-desist orders.  Fan further agreed to entry of an order barring him from participating in penny stock offerings, barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and ordering him to pay $140,000 in civil penalties.

Davis, who tipped material nonpublic information to Walters. In its complaint, filed on May 19, 2016, the SEC alleged that Davis, then a board member of Dean Foods Company, owed Walters money. \xa0According to the SEC complaint, Davis regularly shared inside information about Dean Foods with Walters in advance of market-moving events, using prepaid cell phones and other methods in an effort to avoid detection. \xa0The SEC further alleged that, while Walters made millions of dollars using the confidential information to engage in insider trading, he provided Davis with almost $1 million and other benefits to help Davis address his financial debts.  The SEC action was stayed, in part, pending the outcome of a parallel criminal proceeding. In the parallel criminal proceeding, Walters was convicted of securities fraud and wire fraud and Davis pled guilty to those same offenses, among others.  Following the conclusion of the criminal case, the SEC obtained the recently approved settlements from Walters and Davis.

["On May 1, 2018 a federal court in Jackson, Mississippi unsealed the Commission's previously filed fraud charges against a Mississippi company and its principal who allegedly bilked at least 150 investors in an $85 million Ponzi scheme.  The defendants agreed to permanent injunctions, an asset freeze, and expedited discovery. The SEC's complaint alleges that Arthur Lamar Adams lied to investors by telling them that their money would be used by his company, Madison Timber Properties, LLC, to secure harvest timber rights from various land owners located in Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi, and promised annual returns of 12-15%.  But Madison Timber never obtained any harvesting rights.  Instead, Adams allegedly forged deeds and cutting agreements as well as documents purportedly reflecting the value of the timber on the land.  Adams also allegedly paid early investors with later investors' funds and convinced investors to roll over their investments.  According to the complaint, Adams used investors' money for personal expenses and to develop an unrelated real estate project. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi yesterday also announced criminal charges against Adams. The SEC's complaint, filed under seal in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi on April 20, 2018 and unsealed yesterday, charges Adams and Madison Timber Properties with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, i.e. Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC also charged Premium Point\'s CEO and chief investment officer Anilesh Ahuja as well as Amin Majidi, a former partner and portfolio manager at the firm, and former trader Jeremy Shor. According to the SEC\'s complaint, the scheme ran from at least September 2015 through March 2016 and relied on a secret deal where in exchange for sending trades to a broker-dealer, Premium Point received inflated broker quotes for mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  In addition, the defendants allegedly used "imputed" mid-point valuations, which were applied in a manner that further inflated the value of securities. This practice allegedly boosted the value of many of Premium Point\'s MBS holdings and further exaggerated returns.  The complaint alleges that the defendants overstated the funds\' value in order to conceal poor fund performance and attract and retain investors. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges: (i) PPI, Ahuja, Majidi, and Shor with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) PPI, Ahuja, and Majidi with violations of Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(2) thereunder; (iii) Shor, Ahuja, and Majidi with aiding and abetting violations of Advisers Act Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(2) thereunder; and (iv) PPI with violations of Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder.

As alleged in the SEC's complaint, The Falls builds and operates small event centers.  Since 2011, The Falls and Down raised approximately $120 million from more than 300 investors from the offer and sale of, among other things, convertible secured promissory notes.  According to the complaint, Down solicited investments in The Falls by making presentations to groups of professionals during continuing education seminars that he sponsored.  In his presentations, Down represented that some or all of the event centers were and continued to be profitable.  The complaint alleges that certain of these representations to investors were untrue. According to the complaint, from the first half of 2016 forward, members of The Falls' executive team informed Down that the event centers were not profitable.  In addition, they informed Down that his event center model was unsustainable because of the millions of dollars owed to investors and to the event center mortgage holders. In addition, The Falls' own accounting records, which Down received regularly from the Falls' CFO, indicate that, from inception through September 2017, the event centers were never profitable. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, The Falls and Down have consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Nielson carried out this scheme with the aid of Carolyne Susan Johnson, the Secretary and Treasurer of E-Waste, who consented to entry of a final judgment in the Southern District of Ohio on these and charges related to other issuers. The SEC's complaint charges Nielson with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 16a-3 thereunder, and aiding and abetting E-Waste's violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint against Johnson charges her with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, aiding and abetting Nielson's violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting E-Waste's violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Johnson consented to entry of a final judgment imposing permanent injunctions.  Johnson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company and a penny stock bar, and to other conduct-based injunctions.  The settlement is pending approval by the court. In a separate order, the SEC found that Arthur Kaplan, the executive assistant to Edward Panos, whom  , also participated in a related fraudulent scheme by recruiting participants for sham private offerings and facilitating the transfer of shares to accounts that Panos controlled.  Kaplan, who cooperated with the SEC's investigation, agreed to cease-and-desist from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Kaplan agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the findings. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Virginia Rosado Desilets, Sonia Torrico, Michael Hoess, and Jennifer Clark, with assistance from trial counsel Suzanne J. Romajas and supervisory trial counsel Jan M. Folena, and supervised by David A. Becker.  The SEC's investigation is ongoing.

['SEC Charges Long Island Investment Professional in $8 Million Scam Targeting Long-Standing Brokerage Customers']
['Litigation Release No. 24152 / May 30, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former registered representative with defrauding long-standing brokerage customers in an $8 million investment scam. According to the SEC\'s complaint, Steven Pagartanis, who was affiliated with a registered broker-dealer, told some investors - including retirees who had been Pagartanis\'s customers for many years - that he would invest their funds in either a publicly-traded or private land development company.  He promised that the funds would be safe and also promised guaranteed monthly interest payments on the investments.  At Pagartanis\'s direction, his investors wrote checks payable to a similarly-named entity that was secretly controlled by Pagartanis.  In all, the customers invested approximately $8 million, which Pagartanis used to pay personal expenses and make the guaranteed "interest" payments to his customers.  To conceal the scam, which unraveled earlier this year when Pagartanis stopped making the so-called interest payments to customers, Pagartanis created fictitious account statements reflecting ownership interests in the land development companies. The Suffolk County District Attorney\'s Office today filed criminal charges against Pagartanis. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, charges Pagartanis with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Pagartanis to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay financial penalties.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission charged an equipment leasing company and its founder with defrauding investors in connection with sales of over $80 million in promissory notes.

Iannelli, made a series of false and misleading statements and illusory personal guarantees to registered investment advisers to induce them to invest millions of dollars of their clients' money in Essex's failing equipment leasing business.  The SEC alleges that Essex and Iannelli provided one investment adviser with fake financial statements that overstated Essex's assets by more than $20 million and falsely told another investment adviser that Essex would assign equipment leases to its clients when the same leases had already been pledged as collateral for bank loans.  The SEC's complaint further alleges that as Essex's finances deteriorated, the company resorted to frequent Ponzi-like payments, paying interest and principal to existing Essex investors with funds raised from newer investors.  At the same time, Iannelli allegedly paid himself millions of dollars in bonuses and siphoned millions of dollars out of Essex through interest-free loans with no maturity date.  According to the SEC, Iannelli personally owes the company over $6.4 million. The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Iannelli and Essex with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

['California Attorney Convicted by Massachusetts Jury of Securities Fraud in Scheme to Manipulate Stock of Two Companies']
['Litigation Release No. 24159 / June 6, 2018']
["The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on May 21, 2018, a jury in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts convicted Jehu Hand, a licensed attorney in California, of securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit those offenses in connection with two pump-and-dump schemes that defrauded investors in Greenway Technology, a Las Vegas, Nevada-based company purporting to develop resorts for gay and lesbian travelers, and a second company, Crown Marketing.  He will be sentenced by the court at a later date. The allegations regarding Greenway Technology in the criminal indictment against Hand stem from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's complaint against him.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on December 10, 2015, Hand facilitated a scheme to pump and dump Greenway's stock by authoring false legal opinion letters that were designed to evade restrictions on stock sales by company insiders and clear the way for Greenway stock held by him and other scheme participants to be sold to unsuspecting investors in the market.  According to the complaint, Hand and his co-schemers secretly planned and orchestrated the sale of Greenway stock to the public without proper securities registration statements and at prices artificially inflated by news releases, promotional materials, or blast e-mails containing false, exaggerated or misleading information, and by engaging in undisclosed coordinated trading of the stock. These efforts were designed to generate the appearance of demand for the stock and to increase its price even though Greenway had no operations or assets at the time.  According to the complaint, between August 2012 and January 2013, after the stock price had been pumped, the participants in the scheme sold more than 12 million net shares of Greenway stock, causing losses to the investing public of more than $850,000. The SEC's action against Hand, which is pending, seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and penalties as well as a penny stock bar and permanent injunctions against further violations of the securities laws.

["On June 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Dallas-based oil-and-gas company and its chief executive officer in connection with a series of allegedly fraudulent unregistered oil-and-gas securities offerings that raised millions of dollars from investors. In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Jefferey Gordon and Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC (TCEC) cold-called investors across the country, soliciting their interest in financing the drilling and completion of oil-and-gas prospects in Kansas and Texas in exchange for a share of future oil-and-gas production revenue. According to the complaint, Gordon and TCEC used a combination of false and misleading offering materials and sales pitches to deceive investors.  Among other things, Gordon and TCEC lied to investors about TCEC's experience and track record, the advice and success rate of its geologists, the potential reserves on its prospects, the potential return on investments therein, and the manner in which TCEC would use investor funds.  Ultimately, Gordon and TCEC raised more than $8 million from at least 80 investor victims. While investors lost almost every dollar invested, TCEC and Gordon misappropriated over $2.6 million of investor funds for their own use. The SEC's office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert describing   that an unregistered offering may be a scam, many of which were present here. The SEC's complaint charges TCEC and Gordon with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC also charged Gordon with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act based on his alleged role as an unregistered broker.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, TCEC and Gordon consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating these provisions.   TCEC and Gordon also agreed to be restrained and enjoined from certain activities in connection with the purchase, offer and sale of securities in the future.  Additionally, TCEC and Gordon will be ordered to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties totaling $7.2 million.  Finally, Gordon has offered to consent to associational and penny stock bars.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged a Bellefonte, Pennsylvania insurance agent with engaging in a Ponzi scheme that targeted retail investors who lacked significant investment experience. According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2010 through 2017, James E. Hocker began his relationship with a number of investors by selling them insurance.  After allegedly gaining their trust, he encouraged them to invest with him by falsely promising guaranteed returns of between 10% and 30% from investments he would make on their behalf in the S&P 500 and other unspecified investment vehicles.  Some investors allegedly withdrew money from their life insurance policy or retirement accounts to fund their investment with Hocker.  In fact, Hocker did not invest any of the investors' funds.  Instead, he pocketed the money and used it for his personal living expenses such as credit card bills and to make payments to other investors.  Over the last five years, Hocker raised approximately $1.27 million from about 25 investors.  The investors were largely elderly retirees or individuals nearing retirement, without significant investment experience.  Some of Hocker's investors were widows who relied on Hocker to manage their money following the death of their husbands. The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, charges Hocker with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC's complaint, filed on September 9, 2015 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleged that Pence, who is a former U.S. Attorney and lieutenant governor of Kentucky, misled GEE's investors and auditors after the company discovered that substantially all of its cash - $2.3 million in all - was missing.  As alleged in the complaint, Pence created the impression that he was acting independently as GEE's chairman, when he was in fact a figurehead working on behalf of convicted felon Wilbur Anthony Huff.  According to the complaint, in July 2009, Huff caused GEE to transfer substantially all of its cash to a third party, as part of a criminal scheme masterminded by Huff and an accomplice.  The SEC alleged that Pence subsequently misled GEE's auditors about the missing funds and related-party transactions, and that Pence signed the company's 2009 annual report despite knowing that it included false and misleading statements and omissions. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Pence consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-2 thereunder, ordering him to pay a $200,000 civil penalty, and permanently barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

The SEC\'s complaint alleges that VanBlaricum was the driving force behind a company called Texas Energy Mutual, LLC (f/k/a Texas Energy Management).  Because he was a securities fraud recidivist with a history of running fraudulent schemes, the complaint also alleges that VanBlaricum convinced Rodney Pope and Chet Inglis to serve as the face of the company.  Together, they enlisted Robert Gilliam, Matthew Leaverton, William Hill, and Erik Rhodes to solicit investors.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that the defendants raised over $10 million by guaranteeing investment returns and promising investors that their funds would be used to drill oil wells.  Instead, the defendants used investor money for a variety of personal expenditures, including luxury international vacations and wedding expenses. According to the complaint, VanBlaricum created a "special needs" program to keep dissatisfied investors from discovering the fraudulent conduct.  The defendants allegedly lulled investors with cash Ponzi payments that purported to be a return on their investment or rolled over investors from a failed drilling program to a newer one. VanBlaricum, Pope, Inglis, Gilliam, Hill, and Rhodes each agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC also obtained an order freezing assets in more than 30 brokerage and bank accounts controlled by the defendants. According to the SEC's complaint, Edward Lee Moody and his wholly-owned investment adviser firm CM Capital Management, LLC, has operated a Ponzi scheme and defrauded dozens of investors.  The SEC alleges that Moody obtained $4.95 million from approximately 60 individuals and entities for investment purposes.  Moody represented his firm as a successful money management company that profitably invested client funds in securities.  In order to maintain this illusion, Moody and CM Capital made periodic repayments to investors and sent fictitious monthly account statements that purported to show that clients had earned profitable returns on their securities investments.  The SEC alleges that, in reality, Moody invested none of the $4.95 million, but instead, he used the investor funds to pay off earlier investors, to fund his own speculative trading, and for personal expenses.  Among other expenses, Moody used investor funds to buy a house, a car, remodel his new home, travel, and cover his restaurant and bar tabs. The SEC's complaint, filed under seal on June 27, 2018 and unsealed July 2, 2018 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division, charges Moody and CM Capital Management with violations of the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order freezing assets and other emergency relief. The SEC seeks an injunction, disgorgement, and penalties from Moody and CM Capital.  The SEC also seeks disgorgement from relief defendant, G.E. Holdings, a company that the SEC alleges is wholly controlled by Moody and was used to receive and transfer victim funds. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Devon Leppink Staren and Jeffrey Anderson and supervised by Stacy Bogert and Antonia Chion.  The litigation will be led by Nicholas Margida and Daniel Maher, and supervised by Cheryl Crumpton. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Virginia State Corporation Commission."]

['SEC Charges Real Estate Investment Funds and Executives for Misleading Investors']
['Litigation Release No.  24185 / July 3, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against two real estate investment funds and four executives in connection with their alleged roles in misleading investors by failing to disclose that it could not pay its distributions and was using money from a newer fund to pay distributions to investors in the older fund. The SEC also charged a fifth executive for allegedly signing false SEC filings. According to the SECs complaint, Texas-based United Development Funding (UDF) is a family of private and publicly-traded investment funds that deploys investor capital as loans to homebuilders and land developers. UDF allegedly solicited investors by advertising annualized returns of up to 9.75 percent as well as regular distributions. According to the complaint, for almost five years, UDF did not tell investors that it lacked the monthly cashflow at times to cover investor distributions in one of its older funds, UDF III. Instead, to pay these distributions, the newer UDF IV fund loaned money to developers who had also borrowed money from UDF III. Rather than using those funds for development projects that were underwritten by UDF IV, UDF directed the developers to use the loaned money to pay down their older loans from UDF III. In most of these cases, the developer never received the borrowed funds at all, and UDF simply transferred the money between funds so that UDF III could make the distributions to its investors. UDF III, UDF IV, and UDF executives Hollis Greenlaw, Benjamin Wissink, Theodore Etter, and Cara Obert knew or should have known that they had misled investors about the use of funds and the nature and status of loans made to developers. The complaint also alleges that UDF III failed to appropriately impair loans in violation of GAAP, and that UDF IV did not adequately disclose the status of real property within its portfolio. Finally, the complaint alleges that David Hanson signed false and misleading SEC filings and management representation letters without taking sufficient actions to ensure the accuracy of or a sufficient basis for many of their representations. Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Greenlaw, Wissink, Etter, and Obert agreed to pay $8.2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Hanson agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that order them to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the disclosure, books and records and internal accounting control provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. Greenlaw and Obert consented to also be enjoined from violating the certification provisions of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.

['A former Vice President at ClubCorp Holdings, Inc. has agreed to settle charges that he engaged in insider trading after learning about a possible sale of the company. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Nelson "Frank" Molina, the former Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury at ClubCorp, discovered that ClubCorp was exploring significant transactions involving the company. According to the complaint, despite having signed ClubCorp\'s securities trading policies, which prohibited him from buying or selling ClubCorp securities at any time he had "material non-public information concerning the [c]ompany," Molina subsequently purchased shares of the company\'s publicly-traded stock. Once the news became public, ClubCorp\'s stock price rose more than 16 percent, increasing the value of Molina\'s stock by over $78,000.  After receiving an inquiry from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, ClubCorp contacted Molina, who acknowledged his unlawful trading and promptly resigned from the company. Molina then retained counsel, who reported his misconduct to the SEC staff and provided materials documenting his unlawful trading. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Molina agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Molina will disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay a penalty of $39,230, which is one-half the disgorgement amount.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Maryland-based Owings Group, LLC, three of its related companies and four individuals in an offering fraud that raised over $5 million from approximately 50 investors. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that from 2013 until at least 2014, Mark Johnson, a convicted felon, orchestrated and operated a fraudulent investment scheme with the assistance of three salesmen, Kevin Drost, Brian Koslow and David Waltzer, who were paid substantial sales commissions from the principal invested.  According to the complaint, the defendants deceived investors into believing that Owings was successfully bringing companies public using a quick and efficient streamlined approach, called the Initial Registration Program ("IRP").  In reality, as the SEC alleges, Owings had only an untested idea for a streamlined approach that it was trying out and an inexperienced team.  The SEC alleges that when Owings failed to bring any companies public in the first year, Johnson created two investment funds as a stalling tactic to placate concerned investors and to raise new money to "buy out" the IRP investments from disgruntled early investors.  The scheme eventually collapsed. The SEC\'s complaint charges Owings, three Owings-related entities and Johnson with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and charges Johnson and Owings Capital Funds with violating Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The complaint charges Drost and Koslow with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder and Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and charges Drost, Koslow and Waltzer with aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act.  The complaint charges all defendants with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act and charges Johnson, Drost, Koslow and Waltzer with acting as unregistered broker-dealers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint also charges Johnson as a control person pursuant to Sections 20(a) of the Exchange Act and for committing violations by or through others pursuant to Section 20(b) of the Exchange Act for violations of Sections 15(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder and charges Johnson with aiding and abetting violations of Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 of the Advisers Act.

To help detect potential violations of the securities laws, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires broker-dealers to report suspicious transactions that occur through their firms.  The SEC's complaint alleges that in 2012 and 2013, Schwab terminated 83 independent investment advisers for engaging in activity that Schwab determined violated its internal policies and presented risk to Schwab or its customers.  The complaint further alleges that at least 47 of the terminated advisers engaged in transactions through Schwab that it knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect were suspicious and required the filing of a SAR.  Schwab failed to file SARs on the suspicious transactions of 37 of these terminated advisers.  Schwab failed to file SARs where it suspected or had reason to suspect that the terminated adviser had engaged in a range of suspicious transactions not involving the outright misappropriation or misuse of client funds, including:  (1) transactions involving possible undisclosed self-dealing or conflicts of interest; (2) charging client accounts excessive advisory fees; (3) potentially fraudulent transactions in client accounts; (4) posing as a client to effect or confirms transactions in the client account; and (5) executing client trades and/or collecting advisory fees without being properly registered as an adviser.  Moreover, Schwab failed to file SARs where it suspected or had reason to suspect that the terminated adviser had misused client funds but the client had not complained. The SEC's complaint charges Schwab with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-8 thereunder.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former CEO of a New Jersey-based payment processing company and his romantic partner, in an insider trading scheme that leveraged nonpublic information about an impending merger announcement to generate more than $250,000 of illicit profits for the defendants. According to the SEC's complaint, Robert O. Carr provided his longtime girlfriend, Katherine M. Hanratty, with confidential information about a potential acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. by another payment processing company.  In the weeks leading up to the merger announcement, Carr allegedly gave Hanratty $1 million to open a brokerage account and instructed her to use almost all of the funds to purchase Heartland stock.  The SEC alleges that Hanratty followed Carr's instructions, opening the account and purchasing more than 11,000 shares of Heartland stock.  After the merger was announced, Heartland's stock price rose substantially, and Hanratty allegedly sought Carr's advice about when to sell the stock.  Hanratty ultimately liquidated her entire position in a single day, earning substantial profits on the sale.

Bahgat. The SEC's complaint alleges that Bahgat misappropriated money from seven of his investment advisory clients, in some instances through WealthCFO LLC, a company Bahgat controlled. The SEC also alleges that Colangelo, WealthCFO's operations manager, impersonated one of Bahgat's clients during a telephone call with a broker-dealer holding the client's account and thereby obtained internet access to that account.  This enabled Bahgat to cause money to be transferred from the client's account to Bahgat and WealthCFO.

The jury convicted the defendants on all counts, including securities fraud.  U.S. District Court Judge Raymond J. Dearie has not yet set a date for sentencing. The Commission previously charged Korchevsky, Khalupsky, and over 30 others with securities fraud for trading on hacked press releases in a civil action commenced on August 10, 2015.  The criminal case is based on the same conduct underlying the SEC\'s action.  The SEC charged that Ukrainian hackers used advanced techniques to hack into newswire services and steal hundreds of corporate earnings releases before the newswires released them publicly.  The SEC charged that the hackers created a secret web-based location to transmit the stolen data to traders in Russia, Ukraine, Cyrpus, France, and three U.S. states, Pennsylvania, New York, and Georgia.  The traders are alleged to have used this nonpublic information in a short window of opportunity to place illicit trades in stocks, options, and other securities, sometimes funneling a portion of their illegal profits to the hackers. To date, the SEC has recovered over $53 million and obtained full injunctive relief from the 13 defendants who have agreed to settlements in that case. In February 2016, the SEC also filed a related complaint charging nine additional defendants for taking part in the hacking scheme, SEC v.

According to the SEC\'s complaint, the fraud was orchestrated by the company\'s former CFO Todd Takeyasu, former vice president of accounting and reporting Jeffery Curran, and former operations controller Waldemar Grab.\xa0The SEC alleges that they manipulated the company\'s operating expenses in order to lower a key publicly reported metric concerning the cost of oil extraction and processing needed to sell a barrel of oil.\xa0Penn West allegedly created an internal budget target representing the amount it would improperly move in its publicly-reported financial statements and gave the illusion that it was spending less money to get oil of out the ground.\xa0In fact, the SEC alleges, the company historically struggled to keep its operating costs under control, and Takeyasu, Curran, and Grab managed operating expenses to meet the budget target.\xa0According to the SEC\'s complaint, they frequently met this target to the dollar by having the company record large, round number, and unsupported adjusting journal entries.\xa0Within the company, this practice was referred to as "reclass to capital." As alleged in the SEC\'s complaint, Takeyasu and Curran directed the reclass-to-capital practices without ensuring that the accounting entries reconciled with actual capital spending amounts, and Curran and Grab were repeatedly warned by a subordinate accountant that the reclass entries lacked support.\xa0In September 2014, the company publicly reported that it would restate its financial statements from 2012 to the first quarter of 2014 and its historical financial statements and related audit reports could no longer be relied upon.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Watkins and his companies defrauded professional athletes and other investors out of millions of dollars by telling them that their investments would be used to support waste-to-energy ventures.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, Watkins spent much of the money he raised to cover personal expenses like alimony, past due taxes and credit card bills, and to make payments to prior investors. The Court ruled that the SEC was entitled to summary judgment on its fraud claims based on several investments made by a former NBA player in promissory notes totaling $2,150,000.  The Court found that, when selling the notes, Watkins (1) misrepresented that he and his companies would use the investor's money for specific projects of their waste-to-energy business; and (2) intended to deceive the investor, in that Watkins, upon receiving the funds, promptly used them to repay another investor and to pay various personal expenses, such as alimony and back taxes. In addition to the claims with respect to the former NBA player, the SEC's complaint alleges that Watkins and his companies defrauded other investors.

According to the SEC\'s complaint filed in federal court in southern California on July 6, stock promoter Gannon Giguiere took control of a purported medical device company. \xa0Giguiere, together with a Cayman Islands-based broker, then allegedly engaged in a matched trading scheme that caused the company\'s share price to rise from zero to $1.20 per share. \xa0Giguiere and the brokerage owner, Oliver-Barret Lindsay, allegedly coordinated their matched trading through an individual who turned out to be an FBI cooperating witness. \xa0According to the complaint, despite extensive encrypted communications, the defendants were caught by an undercover FBI operation that recorded their communications, with Lindsay going so far as to tell an individual cooperating with the FBI, "I\'m a little hesitant about typing all of these details into this app.  You can just imagine if it finds its way somewhere it\'s fairly incriminating." \xa0According to the complaint, the pair\'s plan to dump millions of shares in the purported medical device company was thwarted when, this past March, the SEC  \xa0in the securities of the purported medical device company. The SEC\'s complaint also charges three others who began laying the groundwork for a pump-and-dump scheme involving a purported digital media company.  The SEC alleges that Kevin Gillespie, Annetta Budhu, and Andrew Hackett entered into a number of sham stock and debt issuances, and Hackett wound up communicating with someone he believed to be a participant in the scheme who in reality was an undercover FBI agent. The U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the Southern District of California has announced criminal charges in the case. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of California, charges Giguiere, Lindsay, Hackett, Gillespie, and Budhu with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, penalties, penny stock bars, and officer-and-director bars against Giguiere and Gillespie.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against a Miami-based asset manager accused of perpetuating lies about his portfolio manager's investment performance and assets under management, and for stealing approximately $1 million of client funds. The SEC alleges that John Geraci formed the Meridian Matrix Long Short Equity Fund in 2015, and hired Nicholas Mitsakos and his company, Matrix Capital Markets, as the fund's portfolio manager.  Mitsakos had no assets under management, but falsely claimed that he managed millions of dollars of assets and that he had generated returns of up to 66 percent in preceding years.  Rather than verifying these claims, the complaint alleges that Geraci used Mitsakos' false and unsubstantiated claims to market his fund, and eventually obtained $2 million from investors.  Geraci later learned of Mitsakos' deception, and that he had misappropriated approximately $800,000 of the investors' money, but continued to market the fund and to let Mitsakos trade the clients' assets.  Mitsakos returned approximately $1 million of the funds to Geraci, which Geraci then misappropriated for his own use, telling his clients that Mitsakos had lost all of it. The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Geraci with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

["The Securities & Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action against John A. Paulsen, a former managing director and fixed income research analyst at a registered broker-dealer, for aiding and abetting a pay-to-play scheme involving the New York State Common Retirement Fund. As alleged in the SEC's complaint, from early 2014 until February 2016, Navnoor S. Kang was the Fund's Director of Fixed Income, with investment responsibility for approximately $50 billion of the Fund's assets.  According to the SEC's complaint, Kang used his position at the Fund to solicit and receive improper entertainment from Paulsen and Deborah D. Kelley, a registered representative at the broker-dealer.  In exchange, Kang directed millions of dollars in state business to the broker-dealer, generating sizable commissions. The SEC alleges that Paulsen and Kelley planned a ski trip for the purpose of entertaining Kang and his girlfriend.  The complaint alleges that Kang told Paulsen and Kelley that the Fund had very strict rules that prohibited him from accepting anything from Paulsen.  Yet, according to the complaint, Paulsen and Kelley spent thousands of dollars entertaining Kang and his girlfriend.  Paulsen and Kelley then sought reimbursement of those expenses from the broker-dealer, and submited false expense reports which concealed the fact they had entertained Kang on the trip.  Later, when the broker-dealer discovered inconsistencies in the expense reports and began an internal investigation, Paulsen and Kelley conspired to lie, and did lie, to the broker-dealer's internal investigators. The SEC's complaint charges Paulsen with aiding and abetting Kang and Kelley's violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

["On August 6, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Salvadore D. Palermo, a trader formerly employed by J.P. Turner & Company, L.L.C., with entering fictitious sales of market-linked certificates of deposit (MLCDs) in order to avoid J.P. Turner's inventory limitations for the fixed income products. According to the complaint, Palermo paid above-market prices to acquire MLCDs from J.P. Turner brokerage customers, and then held the MLCDs in J.P. Turner's inventory.   To avoid J.P. Turner's inventory limitations, Palermo entered dozens of fictitious trades over a seven-month period, beginning in August 2014.  Palermo entered the sham sales in order to give the impression that the MLCDs had been sold from J.P. Turner's inventory , knowing the named counterparty never agreed to buy the MLCDs and that each trade would ultimately be cancelled.  As a result of these sham transactions, J.P. Turner kept inaccurate trade blotters, showed incorrect asset and revenue account balances, and filed inaccurate Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Reports for each month between August 2014 and February 2015. The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that Palermo aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint seeks a permanent injunction, civil penalties and other relief. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Mark Troszak, under the supervision of Peter Diskin in the Atlanta Regional Office.  The litigation will be conducted by Paul Kim and supervised by Graham Loomis."]

['SEC Charges U.S. Congressman and Others With Insider Trading']
['Litigation Release No. 24231 / August 10, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider trading charges on August 8, 2018, against Congressman Christopher Collins, the U.S. Representative for New Yorks 27th Congressional District, his son, Cameron Collins, and a third individual, Stephen Zarsky. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York announced related criminal charges.\n \nChristopher Collins, who served as an independent director of an Australian biotech company, Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd., is charged with tipping Cameron Collins after receiving confidential information about negative clinical trial results for Innates multiple sclerosis drug. Cameron Collins and his girlfriends father, Stephen Zarsky, are charged with trading and tipping others on the basis of the material, nonpublic information.  \n \nThe SECs complaint alleges that Christopher Collins learned of the negative clinical trial results on the evening of June 22, 2017 in an email from Innates CEO to the board of directors, which stated that the CEO had extremely bad news indicating that drug trial results pretty clearly indicate clinical failure. The SEC alleges that Christopher Collins replied to the CEOs email within minutes, expressing his surprise at the results, and then called and spoke to his son minutes later.\n \nAccording to the SECs complaint, later that same evening, Cameron Collins drove to Stephen Zarskys home and tipped him. The next morning, almost two hours prior to the market opening, Cameron Collins and Zarsky allegedly entered orders to sell Innate shares, which were executed just after the market opened. Over the next two trading days, Cameron Collins allegedly sold a total of nearly 1.4 million Innate shares. According to the complaint, a few hours after the last of these sales, Innate publicly announced the negative results of the clinical trial. The companys stock price then plummeted by more than 92 percent.  Through their sales, Cameron Collins and Zarsky avoided losses of more than $700,000. The complaint also alleges that they contacted other friends and family members who also sold Innate shares in advance of the negative announcement.\n \nThe SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Christopher Collins, Cameron Collins, and Stephen Zarsky with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and permanent injunctions.  It also seeks an officer and director bar against Christopher Collins.  \n \nThe SEC also announced settled charges against Lauren Zarsky, Cameron Collins girlfriend, and her mother, Dorothy Zarsky, for trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information. Lauren Zarsky and Dorothy Zarsky consented to the entry of final judgments without admitting or denying the charges that they sold their shares of Innate based on tips they received from Cameron Collins. Lauren Zarsky agreed to disgorge her ill-gotten gains of $19,440, plus prejudgment interest of $839, and pay a civil penalty of $19,440.  Dorothy Zarsky agreed to disgorge her ill-gotten gains of $22,600, plus prejudgment interest of $975, and pay a civil penalty of $22,600. The final judgments, which require court approval, would enjoin Lauren Zarsky and Dorothy Zarsky from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. Lauren Zarsky, a CPA, has also agreed to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant, which includes not participating in the financial reporting or audits of public companies. The SECs order permits Zarsky to apply for reinstatement after five years. \nThe SECs investigation has been conducted by William Max Hathaway, Colby A. Steele, Patrick McCluskey, and Carolyn M.

['Litigation Release No. 24230 / August 9, 2018']
["The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former registered representative with defrauding his brokerage customers out of nearly $4 million in a long-running investment scam. According to the SEC's complaint, John C. Maccoll, who was affiliated with the Birmingham, Michigan branch of a nationwide registered broker dealer and investment adviser, used high pressure sales tactics to solicit at least 15 of his retail brokerage customers to invest in what he described as a highly-sought-after private fund investment.  Most of the injured customers were elderly and retired and invested through their retirement accounts.  Maccoll told his customers that the purported fund investment would allow them to diversify their portfolios, receive annual investment returns as high as 20%, and give them investment growth potential that was better than the growth they received in their brokerage accounts.  As alleged in the complaint, Maccoll's statements to his customers were false - he did not invest the customers' money but stole it for his own personal use.  In total, the customers invested nearly $4 million in the fraudulent scheme.  To conceal the scheme, Maccoll allegedly instructed his customers not to tell others about the purported fund investment, provided some of his customers with fake account statements reflecting fictitious returns, and paid over $400,000 in Ponzi-like payments to certain of the customers to keep the scheme alive. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today filed criminal charges against Maccoll. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Maccoll with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Maccoll to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Richard G. Stoltz, Craig L. McShane and Anne C. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by John E. Birkenheier, Ms. McKinley and Mr. Stoltz.  The case is being supervised by Kathryn A. Pyszka.

["On August 2, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Plandai Biotechnology, Inc., a penny stock company, and its Chairman and CEO with making illegal, unregistered sales of stock to unaccredited investors and with failing to adequately disclose that proceeds from sales of Plandai stock were sent to a private company owned by the CEO. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the Southern District of New York, from November 2013 through January 2015, Plandai, acting through Roger Duffield, made unregistered offers and sales of Plandai common stock to at least two unaccredited and unsophisticated investors.  In addition, although the shares in question had been newly issued and sold directly to the investors by Plandai, Duffield allegedly instructed the investors to wire their payments to a private company that he owned and controlled.  Plandai's annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, misleadingly stated that Plandai had received cash in exchange for the shares, and did not disclose that the proceeds from the sale were actually sent to Duffield's private company.  Although Duffield, through his private company, ultimately paid various Plandai business expenses in amounts approximating the payments that had been received from the investors, Plandai did not accurately and fairly record these transactions in its books and records.  Plandai's failure to properly record these transactions allegedly resulted from its lack of a sufficient system of internal accounting controls. The SEC's complaint charges Plandai and Duffield with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint also charges Plandai with violating, and Duffield aiding and abetting violations of, the reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of and Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.

['On August 15, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency action against Jerome H. Cohen and Shaun D. Cohen and their companies, Equitybuild, Inc. and Equitybuild Finance, LLC, charging them with operating a $135 million offering fraud involving real estate located primarily on Chicago\'s South Side. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that since 2010, the defendants have sold promissory notes to at least 900 investors throughout the country.  The defendants raised these funds by falsely promising safe investments fully secured by income-producing real estate.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, the defendants took 15-30% of investors\' funds as undisclosed fees, hiding the fees by reporting inflated acquisition costs.  The complaint also alleges that, contrary to defendants\' representations, the real estate did not earn enough to pay the double-digit returns promised to investors.  As a result, the defendants could only pay earlier investors by raising funds from unwitting new investors. According to the SEC\'s complaint, the defendants recently admitted in a video recording to earlier investors that the companies are in financial distress, can no longer afford to make payments to investors, and are cutting staff to a "skeleton crew."  Despite these disclosures, the defendants have continued to solicit new investors for various real estate funds, again offering double-digit returns but failing to disclose the companies\' dire financial condition. The SEC\'s complaint charges Jerome H. Cohen, Shaun D. Cohen, Equitybuild, Inc., and Equitybuild Finance, LLC with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The SEC\'s complaint also seeks injunctions against future securities laws violations, disgorgement of the defendants\' ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. On August 17, 2018, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order which, among other things, enjoins the defendants from raising any additional funds from investors.

The complaint alleges that Lesak and Global did not disclose to prospective investors that Lesak had been barred and had his registration suspended by the NASD, or that in 2013 he had pleaded guilty to and been convicted of both securities fraud and wire fraud related to securities transactions.  Prior to March 6, 2017, the defendants did not tell prospective investors that they were being paid thousands of dollars each month - in many instances tens of thousands of dollars - to promote Axiom stock to investors.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged five individuals and four companies for unlawfully selling securities of Woodbridge Group of Companies LLC to retail investors.  Woodbridge collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2017 and the SEC previously charged the company, its owner and others with operating a massive $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. The Florida-based defendants named in the SEC\'s complaints, Barry M. Kornfeld, Ferne Kornfeld, Lynette M. Robbins, Andrew G. Costa, Albert D. Klager, and their companies, were among Woodbridge\'s top revenue producers, selling more than $243 million of its unregistered securities to more than 1,600 retail investors. The complaints allege that defendants reaped millions of dollars in commissions on their sales of Woodbridge securities even though they were not registered as broker-dealers and were not permitted to sell securities.  Barry Kornfeld also violated a prior SEC order which barred him from acting as a broker. According to the SEC\'s complaints, the defendants touted Woodbridge as a "safe and secure" investment.  The Kornfelds allegedly solicited investors at seminars and a "conservative retirement and income planning class" they taught at a Florida university.  The SEC alleges that Klager pitched Woodbridge investments in newspaper ads while Costa recommended them during a radio program he hosted and Robbins used radio, television, and internet marketing. The SEC filed charges seeking court-ordered injunctions, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and financial penalties against the Kornfelds, Costa, Klager and their companies.  Robbins and her company, Knowles Systems Inc., agreed to settle the SEC\'s charges in a separate action without admitting or denying the allegations and return more than $1 million of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against 1 Global Capital LLC and its former chief executive officer for allegedly defrauding at least 3,400 retail investors, more than one-third of whom invested their retirement funds.  The Florida-based cash advance company and former CEO Carl Ruderman allegedly fraudulently raised more than $287 million since 2014 in unregistered securities sold through a network that included barred brokers. On August 23, 2018, the Honorable Judge Beth Bloom of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted the SEC\'s request for a temporary asset freeze against Ruderman and other Ruderman companies charged by the SEC as relief defendants.  The Court also granted the SEC\'s request to appoint a receiver over certain of the relief defendants - Bright Smile Financing, LLC, BRR Block, Inc., Digi South, LLC, Ganador Enterprises, LLC, Media Pay LLC, and Pay Now Direct LLC.  The Court scheduled a hearing for September 7, 2018, for Ruderman and the relief defendants to show cause, if any, why the asset freeze Order should not continue for the pendency of the litigation or until otherwise ordered by the Court. According to the SEC\'s complaint unsealed yesterday, although investors were promised profits from 1 Global\'s loans to small and mid-sized companies, a large portion of their money went to Ruderman\'s lavish personal spending and to his consumer-loan companies, Bright Smile Financing LLC and Ganador Enterprises LLC, which had nothing to do with 1 Global\'s cash advance business.  Investors in 1 Global allegedly were given bogus account statements and were falsely told that it had an independent auditor, and that its secured loans, typically for small amounts, had low default rates. According to the complaint, in contrast to what it told investors, 1 Global marketed itself to business borrowers as a low-hassle way to access cash quickly, often made large, unsecured loans, and had significant problems with collections. 1 Global declared bankruptcy in July and Ruderman resigned from the company. The SEC\'s complaint charges 1 Global and Ruderman with violations of Sections 5(a), (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Action of 1934 ("Exchange Act").

In its complaint, filed on March 6, 2014 in federal district court in Manhattan, the SEC alleged that Dewey\'s 2010 bond offering fraudulently relied on the firm\'s materially misstated financial results for 2008 and 2009, which were incorporated into the private placement memorandum for the offering and provided to investors.

The Commission also alleged that they instructed Mullikin, Dewey\'s then controller, and others in the finance department, to carry out the scheme.  Davis, the firm\'s then chairman, who was aware of the fraudulent adjustments, made key decisions concerning the offering, including approving the offering and signing off on the private placement memorandum.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida alleges Burstein aided and abetted Quiros' misappropriation and misuse of investor money that flowed through various brokerage accounts held at Raymond James.  Burstein, who is Quiros' former son-in-law, managed those accounts.  According to the SEC's complaint, Burstein facilitated Quiros' misappropriation of more than $21 million of investor funds to acquire the Jay Peak ski resort.

The complaint also alleges that Burstein facilitated Quiros' fraudulent use of more than $18 million of investor money to pay off Jay Peak's margin debt at Raymond James. On April 12, 2016, the SEC filed an emergency civil action against Ariel Quiros, Jay Peak, and others, for engaging in an offering fraud in which, among other things, Quiros systematically misappropriated and misused investor funds.

For example, as alleged in the complaint, on June 10, 2014, Ovations claimed that it "obtained exclusive rights to market" a "sophisticated sputum cytology technology for early and pre stage detection of lung cancer from . . . an officer and director of INOH."  In fact, according to the complaint Goldberg knew this release was false and misleading because Ovations never provided any funding to the individual under its licensing agreement and that individual never served as an officer or director of Ovations. The United States Attorney\'s Office for the Eastern District of New York announced criminal charges against Goldberg, who was a registered representative associated with ten broker-dealers between 1992 and 2003.

The SEC's complaint against Christopher K.

Davies allegedly recruited a series of strawmen to serve as CEOs of American Transportation Holdings Inc. (ATHI), which was in fact a shell company with no operations.\xa0 Meanwhile, according to the SEC's complaint, Davies was behind the company's frequent misleading statements about purported business ventures that ranged from home health care and gold trading to transportation services and game development.\xa0 Davies also allegedly orchestrated a series of press releases in June and July 2016, falsely claiming that the company had entered into agreements with a National Indoor Football League.  Following these press releases and a simultaneous promotional campaign, ATHI's share price soared from under a penny to an intraday trading high of $12, causing the market capitalization of this empty shell company to reach nearly $3 billion. According to the SEC's complaint, Davies' scheme included setting up fake email addresses and using forged documents to cause ATHI to issue stock to entities that he and his associates controlled.  ATHI and Davies allegedly also misled a court in Florida to obtain approval for ATHI to issue shares to another company, which then sold the shares for over $100,000 and paid more than $37,000 to one of Davies' companies.  Over the course of his scheme, Davies caused ATHI to issue at least 271 million shares, potentially worth millions of dollars to entities he controlled.

['Biopharmaceutical Company, Executives Charged with Misleading Investors About Cancer Drug']
['Litigation Release No. 24273 / September 18, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Boulder, Colorado-based biopharmaceutical company, its CEO and its former CFO will pay more than $20 million in penalties to settle charges of misleading investors about the company\'s developmental lung cancer drug. The SEC\'s complaint filed in federal court in Denver alleges that over a four-month period starting in July 2015, Clovis Oncology Inc. and CEO Patrick Mahaffy misled investors about how well Clovis\' flagship lung cancer drug worked compared to another drug.  According to the complaint, the company\'s investor presentations, press releases, and SEC filings stated that the drug was effective 60 percent of the time, far higher than suggested by actual results available internally.  Clovis raised approximately $298 million in a public stock offering in July 2015, and saw its stock price collapse in November 2015 after disclosing that the effectiveness rate was actually 28 percent.  The company stopped development on the drug in May 2016. According to the SEC\'s complaint, in evaluating Clovis\' stock, investors closely followed prospects for its lung cancer drug rociletinib, or Roci, and an important driver was its "efficacy," or how well the drug worked.  In May 2015, Clovis disclosed in an investor presentation that Roci\'s efficacy was 60 percent, meaning that in 60 percent of patients, Roci caused targeted tumors to shrink.  The complaint alleges that soon after, certain data provided to Mahaffy and Erle Mast, the company\'s CFO at that time, showed that Roci\'s efficacy rate was substantially lower and by early July 2015, Mahaffy and Mast learned that the efficacy for Roci at that time was 42 percent.  Clovis continued referring to the 60 percent efficacy figure, including in the solicitation materials for the July 2015 offering and afterward.  In November 2015, after Clovis disclosed the true efficacy, using the methodology required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, its stock price dropped approximately 70 percent. The SEC\'s complaint charges Clovis with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\xa0 The complaint charges Mahaffy with violating Section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting Clovis\' violations of Section 13(a).  The complaint charges Mast with aiding and abetting Clovis\' federal securities laws violations.  The defendants agreed to the settlements without admitting or denying the allegations and the settlements are subject to court approval.  Clovis agreed to a $20 million penalty.  Mahaffy agreed to a $250,000 penalty. Mast agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty and to provide disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $454,145, attributable to selling Clovis stock during the relevant period at inflated prices.  The SEC plans to seek the creation of a Fair Fund for distribution of the penalties to harmed investors. The SEC\'s investigation was conducted by Michael Cates and Kim Greer and supervised by Ian Karpel and Kurt Gottschall in the Denver Regional Office.']

['SEC Charges Michigan Registered Representative with Misappropriating Brokerage Customer Funds']
['Litigation Release No. 24274 / September 18, 2018']
["The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former registered representative with defrauding his brokerage customers - including many elderly retirees and unsophisticated investors - out of more than $2.7 million in a multi-year investment scam. According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2014 through 2016, Ernest J. Romer, III persuaded at least 30 of his customers, many of whom invested most of their life savings with Romer, to sell securities in their brokerage accounts and transfer the proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC or CoreCap Solutions, LLC.  Romer allegedly represented to his customers that upon transferring the money, he would invest it in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current investments.  Based on Romer's misrepresentations, the customers believed that CoreCap Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with a broker-dealer where he worked.  Romer's alleged statements to his customers were false.  As alleged in the complaint, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer's personal businesses, and Romer did not invest the customers' money in the stock market for their benefit.  He allegedly stole the money and used it to benefit himself and his family, to conduct trading in his own brokerage account, to make Ponzi-like payments to other customers, and to repay customers from his prior brokerage firm who had suffered losses on an investment Romer had recommended. The SEC's complaint, filed in the federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Romer with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Romer to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Marlene Key-Patterson and Wilburn Saylor of the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by Steven Klawans.  The litigation will be led by John E. Birkenheier and Ms. Key-Patterson.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Macomb County, Michigan Prosecutor's Office."]

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Sientra, Inc., a California-based medical aesthetics company, and its former CEO, Hani Zeini, with concealing damaging news about the company\'s sole-source manufacturer before it closed a $60 million stock offering in 2015.  The company agreed to settle the SEC\'s charges. According to the SEC\'s complaint, Sientra sells silicone breast implants in the United States, and at the time of the offering, all of the implants it sold were made by a company in Brazil.  Three days before Sientra was preparing to close a stock offering for more than $60 million, Zeini allegedly learned from the Brazilian company\'s CEO that its Brazilian manufacturer\'s "CE certificate," which is a sign of regulatory compliance required to sell products in the European Union, had been suspended.  Zeini allegedly concealed this information from Sientra\'s general counsel and the underwriters for the offering.  The day after the offering closed, news of the suspension became public, and Sientra\'s stock price fell 52.6% from $20.58 to $9.70 per share after it issued a release disclosing the suspension.  Even after that, Zeini allegedly lied to those asking about the matter, and tried to destroy the records that showed he knew about the CE certificate suspension. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Hani Zeini with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks a penalty, an officer and director bar, and a permanent injunction. Without admitting or denying the findings, Sientra, consented to the entry of the SEC\'s order, which finds Sientra violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Sientra to cease and desist from future violations of these statutes.  In considering whether to accept Sientra\'s settlement the SEC considered Sientra\'s prompt action upon discovering the alleged fraud, self-reporting to the SEC, and extensive cooperation with the agency\'s investigation. The SEC\'s investigation was conducted by Matthew Montgomery and was supervised by Robert Conrrad of the Los Angeles office.  The SEC\'s litigation against Mr. Zeini will be handled by Amy Longo and Matthew Montgomery.']

The SEC's complaint alleges that from December 2012 to October 2016, Steele Financial Inc. and Tamara Steele sold to advisory clients and other investors more than $15 million of the securities of Behavioral Recognition Systems Inc.

["On September 7, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two brokers for recommending excessive levels of trading that were costly for retail customers but lucrative for the brokers. In separate complaints filed in federal court in Manhattan on Friday, the SEC alleges that Florida resident Emil Botvinnik and New York resident Jovannie Aquino recommended frequent, short-term trades that generated large commissions for the brokers but were almost guaranteed to lose money for their customers. According to the SEC's complaints, Botvinnik's and Aquino's customers - a number of whom were at or near retirement age - lost approximately $3.6 million as a result of the trades while the brokers pocketed approximately $4.6 million in commissions. The complaints also allege that both brokers engaged in unauthorized trading and concealed material information from their customers about the transaction costs associated with their recommendations, which were likely to outstrip any potential monetary gains in the accounts. The SEC's complaints charge Botvinnik and Aquino with violations of antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint today in U.S. District Court for the W.D. Louisiana against Lafayette, Louisiana-based World Tree Financial, LLC and its majority-owner and co-founder, Wesley Kyle Perkins, for operating a cherry-picking scheme that defrauded World Tree clients. The complaint alleges that for more than four years, Perkins reaped substantial profits at his clients' expense by cherry-picking trades.  Perkins allegedly traded securities in World Tree's omnibus account and delayed allocating the securities to specific client accounts until he had observed the securities' performance over the course of the day.  He then allocated profitable trades to favored accounts, like his own, while allocating unprofitable trades to two accounts with substantial assets controlled by one person.  The complaint also alleges that World Tree and Perkins misrepresented to clients that all trades would be allocated fairly and equitably.  In addition, it is alleged that World Tree, Perkins and Priscilla Gilmore Perkins, Perkins' wife and the firm's co-founder and co-owner, falsely represented that they were not trading in the same securities as World Tree's clients. The SEC's complaint charges World Tree and Perkins with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

['Litigation Release No. 24279 / September 20, 2018']
['On September 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged San Diego County, California resident Leroy "Lee" Young and his firm, Young Capital Management LLC (YCM), for conducting fraudulent sales of unregistered securities. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that from January 2013 through December 2017, Young and YCM illegally raised at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors through false promises of high returns on their principal investment.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, Young falsely represented that he would use the investors\' money for fees associated with selling bonds or, alternately, for fees associated with launching a hedge fund.  The complaint also alleges that Young falsely told investors that he would pay returns of ten times their principal investment in sixty days, generated from the proceeds of bond or hedge fund offerings.  In reality, according to the complaint, Young spent the investors\' money on personal expenses, and he has not paid returns to investors or repaid their principal investments. Young and YCM admitted the allegations in the complaint and have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, and the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering Young to pay disgorgement of $336,450, prejudgment interest of $18,923, and a civil penalty of $336,450.  The proposed settlement is subject to Court approval.  Based on the anticipated entry of an injunction, Young has agreed to the issuance of an SEC order that permanently bars him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in an offering of a penny stock. The SEC also brought settled administrative proceedings against Michael L. LaPenna and Kentucky-based lawyer Phillip R. Grogan.  According to the SEC\'s orders, LaPenna recruited investors by making material misrepresentations about Young\'s investment program, and Grogan facilitated the transfer of investor funds through his trust account, giving investors the false and misleading impression that their principal was safely escrowed with an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\'s findings, LaPenna agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $22,500, prejudgment interest of $583, and a $22,500 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\'s findings, Grogan agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he caused Young\'s antifraud violations; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $3,050, prejudgment interest of $248, and a $3,050 civil penalty.

The SEC also charged BBSI in the accounting fraud and charged the company\'s former controller for his role in improperly approving certain of the CFO\'s accounting entries. Both BBSI and the former controller agreed to settle the Commission\'s charges against them. The SEC\'s complaint against BBSI\'s former CFO James D. Miller, filed in federal district court in the Western District of Washington, alleges that Miller manipulated BBSI\'s accounting records to hide the fact that its workers\' compensation expense was increasing relative to its revenue. According to the complaint, Miller took steps to conceal from BBSI\'s independent auditor a third-party actuarial report concluding that BBSI needed to add tens of millions of dollars to its workers\' compensation liability. BBSI\'s stock dropped 32 percent when the Vancouver, Washington-based firm announced it needed to restate its financial results to reflect increased workers\' compensation expenses.  The SEC\'s complaint alleges Miller violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), and Rules 10b-5 and 13a-14 thereunder, and Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

['SEC Charges Ohio Broker with Defrauding Senior Customers']
['Litigation Release No. 24287 / September 25, 2018']
["The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former Dayton, Ohio registered representative with defrauding his retail brokerage customers out of over $1 million in a long-running scheme. According to the SEC's complaint, John Greg Schmidt, who was associated with an SEC-registered broker dealer, sold securities of at least seven of his customers and secretly transferred over $1 million in proceeds to 10 other customers to cover shortfalls in their accounts.  As alleged in the complaint, Schmidt accomplished his scheme by making unauthorized sales and withdrawals from   held by the customers, secretly transferring funds using fraudulent letters of authorization, and issuing fake account statements.  Most of the injured customers were elderly with little to no financial expertise and were particularly vulnerable.  Schmidt received over $230,000 in brokerage commissions from these customers. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Southern District of Ohio, charges Schmidt with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Schmidt to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.

['SEC Obtains Consent Judgment Against Investment Advisor and Principal']
['Litigation Release No. 24285 / September 21, 2018']
['On September 13, 2018, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia entered a consent judgment against Nashville, Tennessee based Hope Advisors, LLC ("Hope") and its principal, Karen Bruton, in connection with their scheme to collect extra monthly fees from a pair of hedge funds they managed. In its complaint, filed on May 31, 2016, the SEC\xa0alleged that Hope and Bruton managed two private hedge funds in which their only compensation was an incentive fee, calculated as a share of the profits earned in the funds\' accounts each month. The complaint alleged that Hope and Bruton engaged in a continuous pattern of trading to inflate their incentive fee by structuring trading so that a profit would be realized at the end of the month and guaranteeing that losses would not be realized until the following month.  Many of these trades could not reasonably have been expected to generate a profit for the funds, and thus served solely to generate advisory fees for Hope to the detriment of the funds\' investors.  The scheme allegedly enabled Hope to avoid realizing more than $50 million in losses in the hedge funds while earning millions of dollars in fees to which it was not entitled.  According to the complaint, if Hope and Bruton had not engaged in the scheme, they would have received almost no incentive fees between at least October 2014 and June 2016. The court entered the consent judgment against Hope and Bruton ordering them to pay disgorgement of $1,237,235 and a civil penalty of $250,000. The judgment also enjoins them from violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four individuals and their associated entities with carrying out a long-running and complex fraud on investors in the Melrose Resort on Daufuskie Island, South Carolina. The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that J.T. Bramlette of Salt Lake City was the ringleader of the fraud and arranged for the purchase of the Melrose Resort in 2011.  The other defendants, Anthony Hartman, Travis Kozlowski and Aaron Wernli, helped raised money for the project.  According to the complaint, from at least 2014, investors were promised returns of up to 24% and were encouraged to put their retirement savings in the resort.  In reality, the resort was uninhabitable and was suffering significant losses each month.  The resort was in foreclosure and parts of it were put up for auction for unpaid property taxes.  The defendants lost their ownership in the resort when they defaulted on a series of loans, but continued to raise money from unsuspecting investors without disclosing that they had lost everything.  In addition, Bramlette used a substantial amount of investor funds to pay for his lavish lifestyle, including purchases on Rodeo Drive, and automobiles for friends and family.  Some investor money was also used to make Ponzi-like payments to investors. The SEC's complaint charges Bramlette, Hartman, Kozlowski, Wernli, the Pelorus Group, Private Placement Capital Notes II, LLC, Stone Mountain Equities, LLC and Entelecus Fund, LLC with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

The complaint alleges that Uresti, then a licensed attorney and Texas state senator, provided a veneer of credibility to FWLL and served as the company\'s counsel, broker, and escrow agent.  Together, Uresti and Bates allegedly raised over $11 million by misrepresenting the profitability and safety of investments in the FWLL venture, including presenting a doctored bank statement to investors showing that FWLL had over $18 million in cash, when in reality the company had less than $100,000.  According to the complaint, Uresti convinced one of his legal clients, a financially unsophisticated single mother, to invest $900,000, which came from a wrongful death settlement that Uresti had secured on her behalf after the death of two of her children.  Uresti allegedly received large, undisclosed commissions for his solicitations, and Bates spent most of the investors\' money on lavish and improper payments and expenses.

['SEC Charges Salix Pharmaceuticals and Former CFO with Making False Statements About Distribution Channel']
['Litigation Release No. 24302 / October 1, 2018']
[" - On September 28, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. and its former CFO with repeatedly misleading analysts and investors about the company's future prospects.  The former CFO, Adam Derbyshire, will pay more than $1 million to settle the charges. According to the SEC's complaints filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Salix and Derbyshire made false statements to analysts and investors during quarterly earnings calls by significantly understating the amount of Salix drugs that wholesaler customers held in inventory.  Salix had engaged in a long-standing practice of flooding the distribution channel by using incentives to induce customers to purchase more products, creating a short-term revenue bump but excess supply that imperiled future sales.  The complaints allege that Salix and Derbyshire also failed to disclose in SEC reports that the practice had impacted earnings and presented a significant risk to Salix investors.  Salix is now a subsidiary of Bausch Health Companies Inc., which was previously known as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.  The alleged misconduct occurred prior to Salix's acquisition by Valeant. To settle the charges, Salix, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, agreed to be enjoined from future violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b) and  13a-13.  The SEC's settlement with Salix reflects the company's self-report to the Commission and its significant cooperation with the investigation.  The proposed settlement is subject to district court approval. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, Derbyshire agreed to a permanent injunction against violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5(b), and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-13 thereunder.  He also agreed to pay $558,534 in disgorgement and interest, plus a penalty of $494,836, and to be barred for five years from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The proposed settlement is subject to district court approval.  Derbyshire separately agreed to be suspended from appearing and practicing before the SEC as an accountant, which includes not participating in the financial reporting or audits of public companies.  The SEC's order would permit Derbyshire to apply for reinstatement after five years. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michelle Bougdanos and Nicholas Margida, with assistance from James Smith, Christian Schultz, and Matthew Scarlato.  The case was supervised by David Frohlich."]

['Litigation Release No. 24303 / October 3, 2018']
['On September 28, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Russell Craig and his company, OneStep Financial Services, LLC with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws by promising investors profits in return for depositing funds into escrow for the purchase or development of real estate properties, and then misappropriating investor funds. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that in one of the schemes, Craig defrauded an investor of more than $900,000 between 2014 and 2016 and misappropriated over $600,000.  Craig misrepresented that the investor\'s funds would remain in escrow and be used only for the purpose of obtaining a "proof of funds" to purchase a condominium property known as the Heritage Condominiums in Atlanta, Georgia.  Craig also misrepresented that, after the property was purchased, the investor would receive a return of the principal plus a profit of approximately 30% in a short period of time.  Despite these promises, Craig almost immediately transferred these funds to bank accounts that he controlled or to third parties.  The SEC\'s complaint also alleges that Craig encouraged the investor to take out loans to further fund the investment, misrepresenting that Craig would make payments on the loans with his own funds until the real estate transaction closed.  Instead, Craig allegedly used the investor\'s escrowed funds to make the payments. The SEC further alleges that Craig and OneStep engaged in a similar scheme in late 2017.  In this scheme, Craig and OneStep defrauded at least five investors, who were told that their funds were being used for a real estate development project, of $460,000 by guaranteeing high profits and then misappropriating the funds for other purposes. The SEC\'s complaint charges Craig and OneStep with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC\'s complaint seeks a judgment against the defendants providing for permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The complaint also names Peter Baker, Elizabeth Oharriz, Prestige Global Trading, Ltd., and Diversified Initiatives Consulting & Logistics, Inc. as relief defendants, seeking disgorgement with prejudgment interest against them. The SEC\'s investigation is led by Christina McGill and Matthew B. Reisig, with assistance from Richard G. Lill, and is supervised by Timothy England and Melissa Hodgman.

Hanratty, with confidential information about a potential acquisition of his company by another payment processing company.  In the weeks leading up to the merger announcement, Carr allegedly gave Hanratty $1 million to open a brokerage account and instructed her to use almost all of the funds to purchase Heartland stock.  The SEC alleged that Hanratty followed Carr's instructions, opening the account and purchasing more than 11,000 shares of Heartland stock.  After the merger was announced, Heartland's stock price rose substantially, and Hanratty allegedly sought Carr's advice about when to sell the stock.  Hanratty ultimately liquidated her entire position in a single day, earning substantial profits on the sale. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hanratty consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders her to pay $277,980 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest as well $250,628 as a penalty.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Virginia real estate developer with skimming investor funds that were intended for use in purchasing an office building near the site of a planned commuter rail station on the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's Silver Line.  The complaint also alleged commingling and misappropriation of investments in various real-estate and other projects. As alleged in the SEC's complaint, over at least a four year period, Todd Elliott Hitt used two of his companies - Kiddar Capital LLC and Kiddar Group Holdings, Inc. - to raise more than $20 million from investors for the purpose of acquiring and operating the Silver Line office building, new home construction in Northern Virginia, and a fund managed by Hitt that invested in a start-up business.  The SEC alleges that Hitt made misrepresentations about his own investments in the ventures and misappropriated several million dollars of investor funds to support his extravagant lifestyle and make Ponzi-like payments to prior investors. As part of his settlement with the SEC, the terms of which remain subject to court approval, Hitt consented to entry of a judgment freezing his assets and imposing conduct-based injunctions that enjoin him from participating in the offer or sale of interests in real estate development companies.  Hitt has also consented to the appointment of a receiver over a number of the corporate defendants and relief defendants.  Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the Receiver would protect investors, prevent asset dissipation and loss, and attend to the businesses.  Penalties and disgorgement would be determined by the court at a later date.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it filed a subpoena enforcement action against the Saint James Holding and Investment Company Trust and its sole trustee, Jeffre James. According to the SEC\'s application, filed on October 5, 2018 in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the SEC is investigating whether certain individuals or entities engaged in a potential "pump-and-dump" scheme in the stock of Cherubim Interests, Inc., among other penny-stock companies.  Because of the SEC\'s concerns regarding the accuracy of Cherubim\'s disclosures, it had   in the securities of Cherubim and other microcap issuers on February 15, 2018 for ten business days.  Based on its ongoing, nonpublic investigation, the SEC has reason to believe that to "pump" its stock price, Cherubim issued false public statements in January 2018 claiming that the company had executed a $100,000,000 financing commitment to launch an initial coin offering ("ICO") for St. James Trust.  After Cherubim\'s stock price and trading volume increased on this news, certain individuals associated with the company may have "dumped" their overvalued Cherubim stock for significant profits. As part of its investigation, the SEC issued subpoenas to St. James Trust and James in June 2018.  The subpoenas called for the production of documents related to Cherubim\'s January 2018 public statements about St. James Trust and its ICO, as well as any agreements or communications among St. James Trust, James, and Cherubim.  According to the SEC\'s application, the SEC made multiple attempts to contact James, extended its deadline for responding to the subpoenas several times, and personally served James with copies of the subpoenas.  James and St. James Trust, however, have not responded to the SEC or produced any documents responsive to the subpoenas. The SEC\'s application seeks an order from the court compelling James and St. James Trust to produce all responsive documents.

The SEC alleges that a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, acting in an undercover capacity, successfully purchased several security-based swaps on 1Broker's platform from the U.S. despite not meeting the discretionary investment thresholds required by the federal securities laws.\xa0 The SEC also alleges that Brunner and 1Broker failed to transact its security-based swaps on a registered national exchange, and failed to properly register as a security-based swaps dealer. The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges 1Broker and Brunner with violating registration provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 5(e) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 6(l) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest, and penalties.\xa0 In a parallel action, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced charges against 1Broker arising from similar conduct.

['SEC Files Charges in Municipal Bond "Flipping" and Kickback Schemes']
['Litigation Release No. 24337 / November 7, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission charged two firms and 18 individuals in a scheme to improperly divert new issue municipal bonds to broker-dealers at the expense of retail investors.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, the defendants - known in the industry as "flippers" - purchased new issue municipal bonds, often by posing as retail investors to gain priority in bond allocations.  The defendants then "flipped" the bonds to broker-dealers for a fee. The SEC also charged a municipal underwriter for accepting kickbacks from one of the flippers. The SEC alleges that from at least 2009 to 2016, Core Performance Management LLC ("CPM"), RMR Asset Management Co. ("RMR"), their principals, and certain of their associates, misrepresented their identities to gain priority in new issue municipal bond allocations.  Municipal issuers typically require underwriters to give retail investor orders the highest priority when allocating new issue bonds, particularly retail investors within the municipal issuer\'s jurisdiction.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, these defendants used fictitious business names, falsely linked their orders to ZIP codes within the issuer\'s jurisdiction, and split orders among dozens of accounts.  After acquiring the bonds, the SEC alleges that the defendants quickly resold them to broker-dealers, typically for a fixed, pre-arranged commission, and often sought to hide the flipping activity from issuers and underwriters by manipulating sales tickets. The SEC alleges that CPM, its principal James P. Scherr, and associates Deborah B. Dora, Sharlene F. Mesite, and Anadel R. Pinzon violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that CPM and Dora also aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; that Scherr and CPM violated Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"); that CPM, Scherr, Dora, Mesite, Pinzon, and associate James J. O\'Neil violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act; that CPM, Dora, Mesite, Pinzon, and Scherr violated Rule G-17 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB"); and that Scherr is liable as a control person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for CPM\'s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the SEC alleges that RMR, its principal Ralph M. Riccardi, and associates Bruce A. Broekhuizen, Douglas J. Derryberry, David R. Frost, Neil P. Kelly, John M. Kirschenbaum, Timothy J. McAloon, Jocelyn M. Murphy, Dewey T. Tran, and Philip A. Weiner violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that RMR, Riccardi, Frost, and Kirschenbaum also aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; that RMR, Riccardi, Broekhuizen, Derryberry, Frost, Kelly, Kirschenbaum, McAloon, Murphy, Tran, and Weiner, as well as associates Richard C. Gounaud, David S. Luttbeg, Michael S. Murphy violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act; and that RMR, Broekhuizen, Derryberry, Frost, Kelly, Kirschenbaum, McAloon, Jocelyn Murphy, Riccardi, Tran, and Weiner violated MSRB Rule G-17. CPM, Scherr, Dora, Mesite, O\'Neil, and Pinzon settled the SEC\'s charges without admitting or denying the allegations, agreeing to injunctions, to return allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties, be subject to industry bars or suspensions, and to cooperate with the SEC\'s ongoing investigation.  In addition, RMR, Riccardi, Broekhuizen, Derryberry, Frost, Kelly, Kirschenbaum, Luttbeg, McAloon, Tran, and Weiner settled the SEC\'s charges without admitting or denying the allegations, agreeing to injunctions, to return allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties, be subject to industry bars or suspensions, and to cooperate with the SEC\'s ongoing investigation. The settlements are subject to court approval.  The SEC\'s charges against RMR associates Gounaud and the Murphys will be litigated in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. In a related action, the SEC instituted settled proceedings against Charles Kerry Morris, the former head of municipal underwriting at broker-dealer NW Capital Markets Inc.  The SEC found that Morris took kickbacks from Scherr and engaged in a parking scheme in which Morris allocated new issue bonds to Scherr with the understanding that Morris would repurchase them.  As a result of this trading, the SEC found that Morris and NW Capital caused Scherr and Core Performance\'s improper unregistered broker activity.  Specifically, the SEC found that Morris willfully violated Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, MSRB Rule G-17, and caused violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC also found that NW Capital willfully violated MSRB Rule G-17, Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, and caused violations of Sections 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC found that Morris\'s supervisor, James A. Fagan, failed reasonably to supervise Morris\'s activities within the meaning of Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, incorporating Section 15(b)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act, and willfully violated MSRB Rule G-27. Morris, NW Capital, and Fagan agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the SEC\'s findings. Morris agreed to pay a total of $254,009 and to consent to an industry bar.  NW Capital agreed to be censured and pay a total of $87,065 and Fagan agreed to pay a $10,000 penalty and to consent to a six-month supervisory suspension. The investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by the Division of Enforcement\'s Public Finance Abuse Unit, including Joseph Chimienti, Laura Cunningham, Warren Greth, Cori Shepherd, and Jonathan Wilcox, with assistance from Deputy Unit Chief Mark Zehner and litigation counsel Nicholas Pilgrim.  Kevin Guerrero and Ivonia Slade supervised the investigation.  Mr. Pilgrim will lead the litigation against Gounaud, Jocelyn Murphy, and Michael Murphy.']

['Stock Research Firm and Co-Founders Charged with Deceiving Investors in Supposedly Unbiased Reports']
['Litigation Release No. 24341 / November 8, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a stock research firm and its co-founders with defrauding investors by issuing reports purportedly based on "unbiased" and "not paid for" research when in reality they received thousands of dollars from issuers as a condition to providing each report. According to the SEC\'s complaint, SeeThruEquity LLC and brothers Ajay and Amit Tandon camouflaged the payments by inviting companies to make a "presentation" at an investor conference in order to receive a research report for free.\xa0 SeeThru and the Tandons allegedly collected up to several thousand dollars in conference presentation fees per company, and the issuers regularly had input into the substance of the supposedly unbiased research reports, even including the price targets at times. The SEC alleges that the Tandons often instructed SeeThru analysts to use different, higher price targets for covered issuers than those yielded through purported quantitative analysis, and the price targets contained in SeeThru\'s reports were typically more than 300 percent above the current trading price of the stock. The SEC further alleges that Ajay Tandon, who serves as CEO, frequently traded in the same stocks that SeeThru was evaluating despite stating in published interviews and elsewhere that neither the firm nor its principals traded in securities for which they published research.\xa0 According to the SEC\'s complaint, Tandon also engaged in scalping, which is a form of securities fraud that occurs when a perpetrator makes a stock recommendation to investors and contemporaneously trades against that very recommendation in the open market without adequate disclosure. "There is a clear line between paid advertising and unbiased research coverage, and we allege that SeeThru and its co-founders crossed it to deceive investors and make money," said Richard R. Best, Director of the SEC\'s Atlanta Regional Office.\xa0 "According to our complaint, Ajay Tandon even scalped multiple issuers, further revealing the biased nature of SeeThru\'s research reports." The SEC\'s complaint, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Ajay and SeeThru with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Amit with aiding and abetting those violations.  It also charges SeeThru with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and the antitouting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act; charges Ajay with violating the antifraud and antitouting provisions of Sections 17(a) and (b) of the Securities Act; charges Amit with violating the antitouting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act; and charges Ajay with aiding and abetting certain of SeeThru\'s antifraud and antitouting violations.  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, a conduct-based injunction that would bar Ajay, Amit, and SeeThru from promoting the issuer of any security, disgorgement, civil penalties, and officer and director and penny stock bars.

Cone used misleading marketing materials in raising more than $3.3 million from investors.  Cone allegedly employed boiler room sales staff who made cold calls to investors and promised them up to 24 percent annual returns from investments in Greenview.

The complaint alleges that, in reality, Greenview had no track record and its sole investment of $400,000 was in a cannabis company that had yet to harvest a crop.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a 35-year-old Kentucky man for his role in a scheme that resulted in the fraudulent offering and sale of at least $15 million of securities to more than 150 investors. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Jared Gabriel Forrester was installed as a figurehead to run Tennessee-based Tennstar Energy Group, Inc., formerly known as Black Gold Resources, Inc.  He misled investors by failing to disclose that two convicted felons actually were running the company.  Despite having no background in oil drilling or production efforts, Tennstar\'s website allegedly described Forrester as having "an immense knowledgebase in oil and gas development and how to effectively maximize profits."  Tennstar offering materials also allegedly claimed that Forrester "had a multitude of roles within the petroleum industry over the years."  The complaint further alleges that Forrester even told one Tennstar investor that he had "worked his way up through the oil fields" and had been in the industry during his "whole adult life."  However, Forrester\'s work history mainly consisted of jobs in hotels and retail furniture sales, as well as a stint as a stock broker trainee. Last year, the SEC   David Greenlee and David Stewart, the two ringleaders behind the oil investment scheme for raising millions from investors, telling participants that the funds would be used to acquire interests in well leases and to recover oil from the wells.  Instead, they steered most of the money into advertising, sales commissions, or misappropriated the money for personal use.  In addition to misstatements about his own experience, Forrester assisted Greenlee and Stewart with the overall operation of the fraudulent scheme.  For example, he incorporated the company at their request, made improper payments to Tennstar sales teams, and sent investor funds to bank accounts controlled by Greenlee and Stewart. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\'s complaint, Forrester consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement plus interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission.

The SEC is seeking an asset freeze and the appointment of a receiver to prevent any ongoing misappropriation or dissipation of assets. The SEC's complaint alleges that Craig Arsenault defrauded clients of his advisory firm, Atlas Capital Management, Inc., who had invested $5.7 million in a company he controlled, ACT Global Investments.  According to the complaint, Arsenault solicited investments in ACT, telling his advisory clients that their funds would be used to make secured loans to doctors for the purpose of acquiring medical equipment.  The complaint alleges that Arsenault and ACT used client funds instead to make unsecured loans to, for example, a used car dealership, and to acquire undeveloped real estate.  As alleged in to the complaint, Arsenault then provided clients with deceptive account statements that made it appear as if these investments were generating substantial income when they were not.  The SEC also alleges that Arsenault misappropriated and misused over $1 million of the client money invested in ACT. The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in the Central District of California, charges Arsenault, Atlas, and ACT with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Arsenault and Atlas with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on January 15, 2019 charges against nine defendants for participating in a previously disclosed scheme to hack into the SEC\'s EDGAR system and extract nonpublic information to use for illegal trading.  The SEC charged a Ukrainian hacker, six individual traders in California, Ukraine, and Russia, and two entities.  The hacker and some of the traders were also involved in a similar scheme to hack into newswire services and trade on information that had not yet been released to the public.  The SEC charged the hacker and other traders for that conduct in 2015 (see  ;   and  . The SEC\'s complaint alleges that after hacking the newswire services, Ukrainian hacker Oleksandr Ieremenko turned his attention to EDGAR and, using deceptive hacking techniques, gained access in 2016.  Ieremenko extracted EDGAR files containing nonpublic earnings results.  The information was passed to individuals who used it to trade in the narrow window between when the files were extracted from SEC systems and when the companies released the information to the public.  In total, the traders traded before at least 157 earnings releases from May to October 2016 and generated at least $4.1 million in illegal profits. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Ieremenko circumvented EDGAR controls that require user authentication and then navigated within the EDGAR system.  Ieremenko obtained nonpublic "test files," which issuers can elect to submit in advance of making their official filings to help make sure EDGAR will process the filings as intended.  Issuers sometimes elected to include nonpublic information in test filings, such as actual quarterly earnings results not yet released to the public.  Ieremenko extracted nonpublic test files from SEC servers, and then passed the information to different groups of traders. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that the following traders received and traded on the basis of the hacked EDGAR information: In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the District of New Jersey announced related criminal charges. The SEC\'s complaint charges each of the defendants with violating the federal securities antifraud laws and related SEC antifraud rules and seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to pay penalties, return their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and enjoining them from committing future violations of the antifraud laws.  The SEC also named and is seeking relief from four relief defendants who profited from the scheme when defendants used the relief defendants\' brokerage accounts to place illicit trades.

According to the SEC\'s application, filed on December 21, 2018 in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the SEC is investigating whether certain individuals or entities engaged in a potential pump-and-dump scheme in the stock of CHIT, PDXP, and VICT.  Because the SEC was concerned about the accuracy of the companies\' disclosures, the SEC   trading in their securities on February 15, 2018 for ten business days.  Based on its ongoing investigation, the SEC has reason to believe that each company issued false public statements in January 2018 to "pump" their stock price, claiming that it had acquired hundreds of millions of dollars of "AAA-rated" assets, even though each company appeared to have little to no assets.  After the stock price and trading volume for each company increased as a result of the news, an entity associated with the companies may have "dumped" their overvalued shares for significant profits. In May 2018, the SEC issued subpoenas to CHIT, PDXP, VICT, and Johnson for the production of documents.

According to the SEC's Complaint, Cody defrauded at least three of his retired clients over a twelve-year period by concealing the fact that their retirement accounts had lost substantial value and were being rapidly depleted. Cody allegedly concealed these losses by leading the clients to believe that their investments were maintaining steady value and that the clients were living off income from their investments.

Cody allegedly continued to hide that the retirees' money was gone by making wire transfers of monthly deposits to the retirees' bank accounts and sending the clients fabricated tax forms.  The SEC alleges that these deceptive acts caused Cody's clients to believe that their retirement savings were secure when, in fact, they were not.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday\xa0charged Giga Entertainment Media Inc. and five of its former officers and directors-Gary Nerlinger, Jarret Streiner, Lawrence Silver, Alfred Colucci, and Charles Noska-with fraud in connection with a scheme to mislead investors. According to the SEC's complaint, between February and August 2016, the company bought at least 559,662 downloads from outside marketing firms to boost the profile of the company's mobile app, SELFEO.\xa0These firms provided Giga with a shortcut to propel its app to the top of the Apple Store download rankings. But instead of disclosing the real cause of the app's artificial meteoric rise, the company misled its shareholders into believing that this success was due to traditional marketing tactics like billboards and radio advertisements.\xa0The complaint alleges that when the company stopped paying for downloads in August 2016, the app's rankings on the Apple Store plummeted.\xa0Rather than come clean about the fact that the spike in downloads was a result of paid download campaigns, the company, Nerlinger, Streiner, and Colucci lied and told shareholders that the number of downloads continued to grow at the same high rate. Further, Nerlinger, Silver, Colucci, and Noska lied and falsified documents to conceal Nerlinger's role as Giga's\xa0de facto\xa0CEO to prevent the investors from discovering his prior criminal conviction for mail fraud. The SEC's complaint, which was filed yesterday in federal court in Brooklyn, charges: (i)\xa0Giga, Nerlinger, Silver, and Colucci with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Noska with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; (iii) Streiner with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and aiding and abetting Giga's violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; and (iv) Giga with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

In addition, Nerlinger, Silver, and Colucci each agreed to a permanent officer and director bar, and Streiner agreed to a five-year bar. The settlements are subject to court approval.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of an Order enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule l0b-5 thereunder, and further enjoining Kaplan from violating Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The Court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of $7,139,884.87, prejudgment interest of $680,157.61, and a civil penalty of $300,000.  In addition, the Court entered judgments against Relief Defendants Lisa M. Kaplan, the Water-Walking Foundation Inc., and Manna Investments LLC, requiring them to pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest thereon, totaling $1,533,440.61.  The final judgments order that funds subject to an asset freeze the Commission previously obtained be used to partially satisfy the financial obligations. The SEC filed on May 19, 2016 its complaint alleging, among other things, that Kaplan repeatedly lied to prospective investors by stating that their funds would be invested in a low-risk, private off-shore trading program that would provide estimated monthly profits of 10 percent.  The complaint alleges that Kaplan did not use investor funds as promised but instead misused and misappropriated investor funds, falsely represented to investors that their funds were invested, sent out false profit statements indicating that investors had earned returns, and otherwise engaged in a variety of conduct which operated as a fraud and deceit on investors.  The complaint further alleges that Kaplan acted as an unregistered broker. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Raven A. Winters and Luz Aguilar, and supervised by Amy S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office.  The litigation was led by Alyssa A. Qualls.  For further information, see Litigation Release No.   (May 27, 2016)."]

['SEC Charges Connecticut Insurance Executive and Two Companies with Securities Offering Fraud']
['Litigation Release No. 24028 / January 11, 2018']
["The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Connecticut resident David S. Haddad and two companies he operates in connection with a fraudulent scheme to raise funds from retail investors.  Haddad and the two companies have offered to settle the case by, among other things, agreeing to pay a total of over $1 million, which includes disgorgement of money Haddad took in from investors and used for his own personal purposes. The SEC's complaint alleges that Haddad operated two companies in the re-insurance industry, Trafalgar Square Risk Management, LLC and New England RE, LLC.  Haddad allegedly began raising money from investors through the offer and sale of unregistered securities in Trafalgar in or before 2012.  He began offering unregistered New England RE securities to investors in late 2014 and, through the Trafalgar and New England RE offerings, raised at least $2.5 million from at least 29 separate investors.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, while making these offers and sales, Haddad, individually and on behalf of Trafalgar and New England RE, made various misleading claims to investors about the use of their funds.  According to the SEC's complaint, Haddad led investors to believe that their funds would be used to build and grow Trafalgar and New England RE when, in fact, Haddad diverted a significant portion of the investors' money for his own purposes, including the purchase of multiple homes, art and antiques, entertainment, and expenses of a dog rescue charity founded by Haddad.  Haddad also used some investors' money to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors.  The complaint alleges that the money Haddad used to support his lifestyle far exceeded Trafalgar's revenues. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, charges Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of these laws.  Haddad and Trafalgar also have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $619,382.43 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $25,131.83. Haddad and New England Re have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $269,080 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest $2,592.66.  In addition, Haddad has agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $181,071 and has consented to the imposition of a permanent bar prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company.  Haddad further has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from providing information to, soliciting, or accepting investments or funds from any investor or potential investors regarding the offer or sale of any securities issued by any entity that he directly or indirectly owns, controls, consults for, or is employed by, unless he first provides such person with a written disclosure regarding his prior regulatory history and maintains written records of such disclosures.

["The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas last week entered consent judgments in a fraud case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against The Ticket Reserve Inc.'s (TTR) former CEO, Richard Harmon, and former COO, John Kaptrosky.  The final judgment against Harmon, who was also Chairman of TTR's Board of Directors, ordered him to pay $945,078.22, including $620,078.22 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $325,000 civil penalty.  Monetary remedies against Kaptrosky will be determined by the Court at a later time. As alleged in the SEC's First Amended Complaint, filed contemporaneously with the proposed consent judgments, Harmon and Kaptrosky engaged in a fraudulent scheme by raising funds from investors through TTR without disclosing that TTR was in severe financial distress.  Harmon misappropriated more than $500,000 from individual investors for his own benefit, including for lease payments on a vacation home and his personal residence.  The SEC further alleged that Ash Narayan, who previously settled the SEC's charges, misappropriated more than $2 million from individual investors.  The defendants also made material misrepresentations to investors regarding the financial health of TTR and prolonged their fraudulent scheme by backdating documents and making Ponzi-like payments to keep the scheme from collapsing. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's First Amended Complaint, Harmon and Kaptrosky also consented to be enjoined from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. These settlements follow an emergency action initiated on May 24, 2016 and  .  In the emergency action, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order halting the fraud along with an order appointing a receiver over TTR. The SEC's litigation is being led by Chris Davis in the SEC's Fort Worth office.  The investigation was conducted by Keith J. Hunter and Carol J. Hahn and supervised by Eric R. Werner.  Jessica B.

Daniel Glick, No. 17-CR-739.  On November 15, 2017, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois filed a criminal information charging Glick, a Chicago-based investment adviser, with wire fraud. According to the plea agreement, from at least 2011 through at least 2017, Glick engaged in a fraudulent scheme to benefit himself to the financial detriment of his clients and two financial institutions.  According to the plea agreement, as part of the scheme, Glick misappropriated at least $5.2 million dollars from clients, provided financial institutions with forged checks and other documents, and lied to clients about the use, status, and safety of their invested funds.  The plea agreement further states that most of the funds that Glick misappropriated belonged to elderly clients, including his mother-in-law and father-in-law and an individual in a nursing home, and that Glick used some of the stolen funds to pay personal and business expenses. On March 23, 2017, the SEC brought an emergency action against Glick and his unregistered, Chicago-Based investment advisory firm, Financial Management Strategies (FMS), based on substantially the same conduct.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Daniel H. Glick and FMS provided clients with false account statements to hide Glick's use of client funds to, among other things, pay personal and business expenses, purchase a Mercedes-Benz, and pay off loans and debts.  The SEC's action also named three relief defendants, including Glick's accounting firm, Glick Accounting Services. On the same day that it filed its action, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order against Glick and FMS and an asset freeze against Glick, FMS, and Glick Accounting Services.

The SEC alleged that, in August 2013, Quicksilver received wire transfers totaling $1.45 million for the benefit of China Energy Corporation.  The funds were destined for certain of China Energy's shareholders by way of Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).  The complaint alleges that Shinderman diverted approximately $630,000 of this money for his and Quicksilver's own use and benefit, including $500,000 to make a four-day loan to a Nevada real estate company.\xa0 According to the complaint, the borrower failed to repay the principal or interest as planned.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a 35-year-old Kentucky man for his role in a scheme that resulted in the fraudulent offering and sale of at least $15 million of securities to more than 150 investors. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Jared Gabriel Forrester was installed as a figurehead to run Tennessee-based Tennstar Energy Group, Inc., formerly known as Black Gold Resources, Inc.  He misled investors by failing to disclose that two convicted felons actually were running the company.  Despite having no background in oil drilling or production efforts, Tennstar\'s website allegedly described Forrester as having "an immense knowledgebase in oil and gas development and how to effectively maximize profits."  Tennstar offering materials also allegedly claimed that Forrester "had a multitude of roles within the petroleum industry over the years."  The complaint further alleges that Forrester even told one Tennstar investor that he had "worked his way up through the oil fields" and had been in the industry during his "whole adult life."  However, Forrester\'s work history mainly consisted of jobs in hotels and retail furniture sales, as well as a stint as a stock broker trainee. Last year, the SEC   David Greenlee and David Stewart, the two ringleaders behind the oil investment scheme for raising millions from investors, telling participants that the funds would be used to acquire interests in well leases and to recover oil from the wells.  Instead, they steered most of the money into advertising, sales commissions, or misappropriated the money for personal use.  In addition to misstatements about his own experience, Forrester assisted Greenlee and Stewart with the overall operation of the fraudulent scheme.  For example, he incorporated the company at their request, made improper payments to Tennstar sales teams, and sent investor funds to bank accounts controlled by Greenlee and Stewart. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\'s complaint, Forrester consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement plus interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the District of Massachusetts announced criminal charges against Polese and Peterson. According to the Commission\'s complaint, beginning in 2014, James S. Polese and Cornelius Peterson, while employed as investment advisers at a large financial institution, engaged in various schemes to defraud their clients, including stealing nearly $450,000 from one elderly client.  In March 2016, Polese and Peterson fraudulently misappropriated $350,000 of their client\'s money, using $100,000 of those funds to make investments in their own names, and directing the remaining $250,000 to Polese\'s personal bank account.  Then, from March through May of 2017, Polese made numerous unauthorized withdrawals from the same client\'s account totaling approximately $93,000 to pay Polese\'s credit card and college tuition expenses for Polese\'s children. In addition to stealing client funds, the complaint alleges that Polese and Peterson breached their fiduciary duty to their clients when they (1) secretly put client funds at risk by using a client\'s assets as collateral to secure loan financing for a private entity in which Polese and Peterson were investors, and (2) invested client funds into an investment in which defendants held a financial interest, without informing the client or disclosing their conflict of interest.  Additionally, Polese defrauded two clients through violations of his fiduciary duties to those clients including (1) obtaining a loan from a client on unfavorable terms to the client; and (2) charging a client advisory fees 50% higher than the rate he repeatedly promised to charge her. The Commission\'s complaint alleges that Polese and Peterson violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Polese and Peterson violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and that they aided and abetted violations of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder.

On October 28, 2010, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Massachusetts against BTR and its principals, Ahmet Devrim Akyil and Craig Karlis, alleging that they fraudulently raised millions of dollars from hundreds of investors in a foreign currency ("Forex") trading venture.  Among other things, the Commission alleged that the defendants misappropriated some investor funds for business and personal expenses and lost the vast majority of remaining investor funds through Forex trading activity after falsely promising investors that most of their funds would be protected from such trading losses.  BTR also provided investors with misleading account statements that did not accurately reflect the firm\'s trading activity. After filing, the case was stayed pending the disposition of related criminal prosecutions of Akyil and Karlis brought by the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney.  Karlis pleaded guilty in March 2014 to nine counts of wire fraud, among other charges.  In September 2014, Karlis was sentenced to nine years in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $4,378,356 in restitution to the fraud victims. In the SEC\'s action, Karlis, formerly of Hopkinton, Massachusetts, consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The judgment also orders Karlis to pay $1,641,067.76 in disgorgement and $549,376.92 in prejudgment interest, for a total of $2,190,444.68, which was deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the related criminal proceedings.

According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Genovese's fraud appears to be ongoing evidence by recent money coming into his account as well as a recent refusal of an investor's redemption request. The SEC's complaint charges Genovese and his hedge fund with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Genovese and his advisory firm with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.\xa0The SEC is seeking a temporary restraining order to freeze their assets and prohibit them from committing further violations of the federal securities laws.\xa0 The SEC seeks a final judgment ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and for Genovese and his investment advisory firm to pay financial penalties. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York has filed parallel criminal charges against Genovese. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Gerald Gross, Alexander Vasilescu, James Hanson, Karen Lee, and Adam Nowicki of the New York Regional Office.\xa0The litigation will be led by Mr. Vasilescu, Mr. Hanson and Ms. Lee.\xa0The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\xa0The SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Steven Vitulano, Terrence P.

According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Todd M. LaVelle, the former chief executive officer and a board member of In Home Medical Solutions, LLC (IHMS) and Ara Chackerian, a former officer and board member of IHMS, both learned of an impending merger between Emeritus and Brookdale Senior Living Inc. from IHMS' Chief Operating Officer.  The merger potentially had significant business implications for IHMS because a subsidiary of Emeritus was IHMS' largest customer.  Before the merger was publicly announced, LaVelle and Chackerian bought Emeritus securities and each sold them for illegal profits of over $25,000 and $157,000, respectively, the day after the merger announcement. The SEC's complaint against LaVelle, filed on February 8, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charges him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, LaVelle agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay $25,342.40 in disgorgement, $2,629.81 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $25,342.40.  The settlement is pending court approval. The SEC's order against Chackerian finds that he violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Chackerian consented to a cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay disgorgement of $157,207.80, prejudgment interest of $18,635.55, and a civil penalty of $157,207.80.

The SEC\'s complaint alleged that between February 2010 and February 2011, Lunn posed as the Vice-President of Dresdner Financial and misappropriated more than $5 million from at least 70 investors located throughout the United States and several foreign countries by promising 100% guaranteed investment returns.  In reality, Dresdner Financial was an elaborate hoax and Lunn did not invest any of the funds.  He instead gave $848,500 to three Las Vegas call girls, withdrew over $1 million in cash and money transfers, made a $1 million Ponzi-like payment to a favored investor, paid over $1.3 million to individuals who helped market the fraudulent scheme, and used the remaining funds to pay for personal and business expenses.

Block, the former CFO of American Realty Capital Properties Inc. (ARCP), a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) now known as VEREIT, Inc. On September 8, 2016, the SEC charged Block with overstating the financial performance of ARCP by purposely inflating a key metric used by analysts and investors to assess the company. The SEC's complaint alleged that Block and then-chief accounting officer Lisa P. McAlister devised a scheme to manipulate the calculation of ARCP's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), a non-GAAP measure used when the company provided earnings guidance. After warnings from internal accounting staff that an incorrect method was used to calculate AFFO in ARCP's 2014 first quarter financial results, Block falsified the company's AFFO presentation in the final hours before filing the company's second quarter results.  With McAlister in his office, Block entered fake numbers that concealed the first quarter overstatement of AFFO and made it appear that the company had met second quarter estimates when, in fact, it had fallen short. The SEC's complaint charged Block and McAlister with violating or aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 as well as aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11, and 13a-13.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained final judgments against a Ridgefield, Connecticut-based hedge fund manager and his investment advisory businesses.  The federal court in Connecticut ordered the defendants to pay nearly $13 million in disgorgement and penalties after the court had previously determined that the defendants had illegally diverted investor money for use by other hedge funds that were illiquid and in need of cash. The court earlier found Stephen Hicks and the businesses liable on the SEC's claim that they misappropriated investor funds.  The SEC alleged that investors were defrauded because they were not told about the transfers of hedge fund assets while they were taking place.  According to the SEC's complaint, Hicks sent a letter to investors admitting that legal and administrative expenses had been improperly allocated between funds, but rather than repaying the money, he transferred illiquid securities to the funds. The February 10th judgments against Stephen Hicks, Southridge Capital Management LLC, and Southridge Advisors LLC incorporated the Partial Final Judgment issued by the District Court on August 2, 2017.  The Final Judgment enjoined the Southridge entities and Hicks from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Section 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and required them to pay $7,864,064 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest that was previously ordered.  Hicks also must pay a $5 million penalty. The additional claims resolved by the final judgments involved accusations that Hicks fraudulently misstated the value of the fund's largest investment to artificially inflate the management fees Defendants collected from investors.  This settlement also resolves allegations that Hicks fraudulently solicited investors by telling them that the majority of their investments would be placed in unrestricted, free-trading shares (meaning shares that were available to be sold), cash, or near cash.

The complaint, which the Commission filed in January 2015, charged investment adviser Daniel Thibeault and others with fraud for misappropriating money from an investment fund.  The complaint named Mr. Thibeault's wife, Shawnet Thibeault, as a relief defendant.  According to the complaint, she received some of the money that had been misappropriated from investors.  The judgment entered against Shawnet Thibeault orders her to disgorge over $500,000. According to the complaint, Mr. Thibeault misappropriated money from an investment fund that he was managing.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that Mr. Thibeault and his companies were the investment advisers to the GL Beyond Income Fund, and that they misappropriated at least $15 million of the Fund's money.  According to the complaint, Mr. Thibeault represented that investors' money would be pooled and used to make or purchase consumer loans.  These consumer loans would then constitute the Fund's assets, and would provide a return to the investors when interest and principal payments were made on the loans.  The complaint alleged that Mr. Thibeault and the other defendants (not including Shawnet Thibeault) engaged in a scheme to create fictitious loans to steal money from the Fund, and to report those fake loans as assets of the Fund.  Mr. Thibeault and the other defendants designed this scheme to conceal their misappropriation of millions of dollars from the Fund.

Engebretson, Bronson\'s brother and the former chief compliance officer of Strong, abdicated his compliance responsibilities and ignored numerous "red flags" raised during the course of the fraudulent scheme. The complaint alleges that for more than four years, Bronson traded securities in Strong\'s omnibus account but delayed allocating the securities to specific client accounts until he had observed the securities\' performance over the course of the day.  Bronson reaped substantial profits at his clients\' expense by "cherry picking" the trades, allocating the profitable trades to himself and the unprofitable trades to Strong\'s clients.

The SEC also alleges that Engebretson failed in his role as chief compliance officer to ensure that Strong\'s policies and procedures regarding trade allocations were implemented and repeatedly disregarded "red flags" relating to Strong\'s allocation practices.

["On January 10, 2018 and February 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments against Jamie Meadows and Eric McPhail, respectively, defendants in an SEC enforcement action filed in July 2014 alleging that McPhail, Meadows and others committed insider trading in the stock of Massachusetts-based American Superconductor Corp.  The SEC has now obtained final judgments against all of the defendants in this case, and has obtained orders for full disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains against the traders. The SEC's complaint, filed on July 11, 2014, alleged that McPhail repeatedly provided non-public information about American Superconductor to six of his friends, including Meadows.  McPhail's source of inside information was an American Superconductor executive who belonged to the same country club as McPhail and was a close friend.  According to the complaint, from July 2009 through April 2011, the executive told McPhail about American Superconductor's expected earnings, contracts, and other major pending corporate developments, trusting that McPhail would keep the information confidential, while McPhail instead misappropriated the inside information and tipped his friends, including Meadows, who improperly traded on the information.  The SEC's complaint alleged that the six traders profited by a total of over $554,000 through their illegal insider trading. The judgment against McPhail, to which he consented, enjoined him from committing future violations of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws.  In June 2015, McPhail was convicted after a jury trial in a related criminal insider trading action brought by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, and in September 2015 he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and two years of supervised release.  The judgement against Meadows enjoined him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered him to pay full disgorgement of $191,521 plus prejudgment interest of $41,841, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $191,521.

According to a complaint filed by the SEC in federal district court for the Eastern District of New York, Sharone Perlstein, Aric Swartz, and Hadas Yaron created at least 15 shell companies by filing false and misleading registration statements and periodic reports with the SEC, creating phony business plans, and appointing nominal officers and directors, who also acted as straw-man shareholders for the shell companies.\xa0 The defendants also conducted putative initial public offerings of certain shell companies.\xa0 In reality, the defendants continued to control the companies' shares and the defendants subsequently sold certain shell companies at a profit of more than $1.8 million. The SEC also filed complaints in federal district court for the District of Columbia against gatekeepers who provided substantial assistance in the fraudulent scheme.\xa0 According to the SEC's complaint against Jonathan Strum, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney, he assisted in drafting false and misleading registration statements and periodic reports and signed fraudulent opinion letters.\xa0 In its complaint against Alan Weinberg, CPA, an Israeli resident, and his Baltimore-based accounting firm Weinberg & Baer LLC, the SEC alleges that they issued misleading audit reports for at least seven of the shell companies.\xa0 Despite numerous audit failures and red flags, Weinberg and his firm issued audit reports falsely asserting that the audits had been performed in accordance with the auditing standards promulgated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The SEC's complaints charge Perlstein, Swartz, and Yaron with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5; Strum, Weinberg, and Weinberg & Baer with aiding and abetting these violations; Weinberg and Weinberg & Baer with violating Exchange Act Section 10A(a)(2); and Weinberg & Baer with violating Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X.

According to the SEC's complaint, on November 20, 2014 at 4:04 p.m., Yang Xie, then-Director of Global Health Outcomes Research for Merck, received an email from a Merck attorney discussing a contemplated merger between Merck and Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  The email included an attachment advising recipients not to trade in Cubist's stock until a full trading date had elapsed after a public announcement of the acquisition.  The complaint alleges that, approximately six minutes later, Xie replied to the e-mail and acknowledged receiving it.  Approximately 14 minutes after he received the Merck attorney's email, Xie bought 80 shares of Cubist stock.  On January 21, 2015, the date the tender offer was completed, Xie sold his Cubist stock and realized illegal profits of approximately 39%.  During the SEC's investigation that followed, Xie allegedly denied learning about Merck's proposed acquisition of Cubist until the night before it was publicly announced.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three Plano, Texas-based oil and gas companies and their principals, together with an accountant and compliance coordinator, for their roles in operating an $11.7 million offering fraud for oil drilling and operations projects allegedly located in Kentucky. The SEC alleges that AmeraTex Energy, Inc., Lewis Oil Corp., Lewis Oil Company, Thomas Lewis (the CEO of all three entities), and former AmeraTex President, William Fort, sold unregistered securities and made numerous misleading statements to over 150 investors concerning the use of investor proceeds, including false information about prospect wells; false statements about sales commissions; and false guarantees regarding the comingling and loaning of funds.  To conceal the growing number of investor and employee complaints that appeared online, the SEC further alleges that Lewis and Fort used services to suppress Internet search results that would otherwise have cautioned potential investors about the nature of the fraudulent offering.  This scheme enabled Lewis to misappropriate more than $1 million. The SEC also alleges that accountant Damon Fox and compliance coordinator Brian Bull played key roles in the scheme by adding legitimacy and credibility to the operations and taking significant actions of their own.  Fox misleadingly categorized entries in the companies\' books and records and sent investors false K-1 statements. Bull reviewed many of the misrepresentations to investors, enabled the solicitation and acceptance of non-accredited investors, and filed false Forms D with the Commission. The SEC\'s complaint charges AmeraTex, Lewis Oil Corp., Lewis Oil Company, Lewis, Fort, and Fox with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and alternatively charges Fox with aiding and abetting AmeraTex\'s, Lewis Oil Corp.\'s, Lewis\'s, and Fort\'s violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a settled action in federal court against the perpetrators of a multi-million dollar fraudulent offering of unregistered securities for a Southern California-based home audio manufacturer. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Dedicated Sound and Audio, Inc. ("DSA"), located in Lake Forest, California, and Steven Ventre, its founder, president, and CEO, retained the services of Choice Equity, a telemarketer controlled by recidivist Eric Lovy (formerly known as Eric Beltran), to solicit investors on DSA\'s behalf.  The SEC alleges that investors in the unregistered offering were falsely told in a private placement memorandum drafted by Ventre and Lovy that DSA would pay no more than 15% of the amount raised in sales commissions to registered broker-dealers.  In reality, over a 20-month span, DSA paid more than 33% ($1.56 million of $4.6 million) of the amount raised to Choice Equity and Lovy, neither of whom is registered with the SEC.  More than half of the commissions went directly to Lovy. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges DSA and Ventre with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, in the alternative, charges Ventre with liability as a control person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for DSA\'s liability under Section 10(b).  The complaint further charges Lovy with aiding and abetting DSA\'s and Ventre\'s violations of these antifraud provisions.  In addition, the SEC charges all of the defendants with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and both Lovy and Choice Equity with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws; imposing civil penalties against each of them; and ordering Lovy and Choice Equity to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest of the collective $1.56 million in commissions that they received from DSA, and civil penalties of $160,000 and $870,850, respectively.

In a related matter, the SEC also filed an application seeking a court order requiring Analytica\'s accountant, Marvin Winick, to comply with an SEC suspension order from 2006. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that from 2013 to 2014, Douglas Murdock, who was an undisclosed control person of Analytica, orchestrated a scheme to fraudulently procure Analytica shares and sell them in unregistered transactions.

Three companies under Muehler\'s control, Muehler\'s wife, Claudia M. Muehler, and his associate, Koorosh "Danny" Rahimi, were also charged.  Because the scheme is ongoing, the SEC is also seeking a preliminary injunction to stop Muehler\'s ongoing violations of the securities laws, pending trial of the action. The SEC\'s complaint, which was filed in federal court in Los Angeles, also charges Muehler with violating a cease-and-desist order issued by the Commission in 2016 barring Muehler from associating with any broker-dealer.  The SEC has filed a parallel action in the same court to enforce that Commission order. According to the complaint, Muehler\'s companies are not registered as broker-dealers.  But since at least November 2015, Muehler and his companies have nonetheless agreed to provide broker-dealer services to more than 20 small businesses, including identifying and soliciting investors and utilizing a purportedly proprietary online securities exchange to help raise funds from investors.  In return, Muehler and his companies received fees, the right to a percentage of any funds raised from investors, and the right to an equity stake in each small business customer. The SEC also alleges that in offering broker-dealer services, Muehler and his companies made numerous fraudulent claims to potential customers, including that Muehler and his companies had $50 million on-hand to invest in their customers\' securities, that they had previously helped customers raise millions of dollars, and that their proprietary online exchange was registered with the SEC.  They also concealed that Muehler is subject to a Commission cease-and-desist order and has been sanctioned by California and Minnesota securities regulators. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Claudia Muehler and Danny Rahimi helped Muehler carry out this scheme. The SEC\'s complaint charges Muehler and the three companies he controls (AltaVista Capital Markets, LLC, AltaVista Private Client, LLC, and AltaVista Securities, LLC) with violating Section 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a), Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and also charges Muehler with violating Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

For instance the Complaint alleges that Shah promised investors he would pay them monthly returns and guaranteed against losses.

['Court Enters Default Judgment Against "Smart Money" Financial Adviser Charged By The SEC With Securities Fraud']
['Litigation Release No. 24087 / March 28, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that a default judgment as to liability has been entered against DaRayl D. Davis, a self-styled "Financial Coach" charged in December 2017 with operating an offering and investment advisory fraud. On December 22, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that Davis raised more than $5 million from approximately 30 investors by selling them fictitious financial products described as "corporate bond notes" and "guarantee bonds."  Davis hosted seminars marketed as the "Smart Money Academy" and "The Smart Money Millionaire Experience," and used his religious affiliation to gain investors\' trust.  Investors believed the financial products sold by Davis were legitimate and would preserve and grow their investments.  The complaint alleges that the investments were not legitimate and that Davis fabricated documents and made false statements concerning the fictitious financial products.  Davis did not invest the money he raised from his clients, but instead used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle, repay prior investors, and further his fraudulent scheme. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Davis violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty from Davis, as well as disgorgement from relief defendant Affluent Advisory Group, LLC, against which default judgment as to liability also was entered. At the time it filed its complaint, the SEC requested a temporary restraining order and an order temporarily freezing Davis\'s assets, both of which were granted the same day.  On January 24, 2018, the Honorable Amy J. St. Eve granted the SEC\'s motion for a preliminary injunction, extended the asset freeze pending final judgment in the case, and entered default against Davis.  At a hearing on March 26, 2018, Judge St. Eve entered default judgment against Davis as to liability, as well as against relief defendant AAG.  Judge St. Eve also held Davis in contempt for violating the asset freeze and scheduled a hearing for May 10, 2018 to determine how to proceed with the remedies phase of the case. The SEC\'s investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson, Norman P. Ostrove, and Jacquelyn D. King, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  The litigation is being handled by Mark R.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged the pastor of one of the largest Protestant churches in the country and a self-described financial planner in a scheme to defraud elderly investors by selling them interests in defunct, pre-Revolutionary Chinese bonds. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that, in 2013 and 2014, Kirbyjon Caldwell, Senior Pastor at Windsor Village United Methodist Church in Houston, and Gregory Alan Smith, a self-described financial planner who FINRA has barred from the broker-dealer business since 2010, targeted vulnerable and elderly investors with false assurances that the bonds-collectible memorabilia with no meaningful investment value-were worth millions of dollars.  Caldwell and Smith raised at least $3.4 million from 29 mostly elderly investors, some of whom liquidated their annuities to invest in this scheme.  Caldwell and Smith are alleged to have taken approximately $1.8 million of investor funds to pay for personal expenses, including mortgage payments in the case of Caldwell and luxury automobiles in the case of Smith.  Offshore individuals received most of the remaining funds. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Caldwell and Smith violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Smith violated Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Commission\'s complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement with prejudgment interest against Caldwell and Smith, and an officer and director bar against Caldwell. In a separate complaint the SEC charged attorney Shae Yatta Harper of Monmouth Junction, New Jersey, with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and aiding and abetting Caldwell\'s and Smith\'s violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder..  Harper agreed to settle the SEC\'s complaint against her without admitting or denying the SEC\'s allegations.  Among other things, Harper agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty and to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commission\'s Rules of Practice that suspends her from appearing or practicing as an attorney before the Commission with the right to request that the Commission consider her reinstatement after five years.

Bercowy with a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the stock price of Aureus, Inc., a penny stock company incorporated in Nevada. The SEC alleges that between August 4 and August 15, 2016, Bercowy, who is associated with a state-registered investment adviser, sold shares of certain Fortune 500 companies, including Abbott and Apple, in his relative's brokerage account in order to buy over three million shares of Aureus at a total cost of more than $2.8 million.  According to the SEC's complaint, while Bercowy was accumulating these shares of Aureus, he entered (and later cancelled) a large number of orders to buy Aureus shares at prices higher than the then-current price of the stock. The orders allegedly were intended solely to maintain or boost the stock's price.  The price per share of Aureus securities increased from $0.52 on August 4, 2016, to $1.62 on August 16, 2016.  According to the SEC's complaint, Bercowy stated in recorded phone calls with a representative of a brokerage firm that he and others were trying to boost Aureus's stock price.

The SEC\'s complaint, filed March 30, 2018, alleges that Michael Liberty, his wife, Brittany Liberty, his cousin, Richard Liberty, Paul Hess, and attorney George Marcus induced investors to purchase unregistered interests in shell companies controlled by Michael Liberty that supposedly owned transferrable interests in Mozido.  In reality, the shell companies either did not own, or were not permitted to transfer, interests in the company.  The SEC also alleges that Michael Liberty and his accomplices lied to investors about Mozido\'s valuation and finances, the amount Michael Liberty had personally invested in Mozido, and the use of their funds.

['Rio Tinto, Former Top Executives Charged with Fraud']
['Worldwide Mining Company Alleged to Have Inflated Asset Values']
["On October 17, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged mining company Rio Tinto and two former top executives with fraud for inflating the value of coal assets acquired for $3.7 billion and sold a few years later for $50 million. The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Rio Tinto, its former CEO Thomas Albanese, and its former CFO Guy Elliott failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record its assets.\xa0 Instead, as the project began to suffer one setback after another resulting in the rapid decline of the value of the coal assets, they sought to hide or delay disclosure of the nature and extent of the adverse developments from Rio Tinto's Board of Directors, Audit Committee, independent auditors, and investors. Based on the complaint's allegations, Rio Tinto plc, Rio Tinto Limited, Albanese, and Elliott are charged with violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.\xa0 The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and civil penalties from all the defendants, and seeks to bar Albanese and Elliott from serving as public company officers or directors. According to the SEC's complaint, in 2011, Rio Tinto acquired coal assets in Mozambique shortly after disclosing huge losses associated with its previous large-scale acquisition of Alcan.\xa0 Both acquisitions took place under Albanese's leadership.\xa0 The second acquisition was also unsuccessful as it was based on the incorrect assumption that Rio Tinto could inexpensively mine, transport, and sell large quantities of high-quality coal, chiefly using barges for shipping.\xa0 The SEC's complaint alleges that the project suffered setbacks almost immediately, as Rio Tinto, Albanese, and Elliott learned that there was less coal and of lower quality than expected, and that Mozambique had rejected its barge application. The complaint alleges that the drop in quantity and quality of coal, coupled with the lack of infrastructure to transport it, significantly eroded the value of the acquisition. The complaint alleges that after already impairing Alcan twice, Rio Tinto, Albanese, and Elliott knew that publicly disclosing its second failure and rapidly declining value would call into question their ability to pursue the core of Rio Tinto's business model to identify and develop long-term, low-cost, and highly-profitable mining assets.\xa0 Instead, they concealed the adverse developments, allowing Rio Tinto to release misleading financial statements days before a series of U.S. debt offerings.\xa0 Rio Tinto raised $5.5 billion from U.S. investors, approximately $3 billion of which was raised after May 2012, when executives at Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique had already told Albanese and Elliott that the subsidiary was likely worth negative $680 million.\xa0 The complaint alleges Albanese then repeated and reinforced the false positive outlook for the project in public statements. The alleged fraud continued until January 2013, when an executive in Rio Tinto's Technology & Innovation Group discovered that the coal assets were being carried at an inflated value on Rio Tinto's financial statements.\xa0 After an internal review allegedly triggered by the executive's report to Rio Tinto's Chairman, Rio Tinto announced that Albanese had resigned and the company reduced the value of the coal assets by more than $3 billion, or more than 80 percent.\xa0 After a second reduction, Rio Tinto sold the Mozambique subsidiary for $50 million, billions of dollars below the acquisition price. The SEC's investigation was conducted by D. Mark Cave, Jeffrey Weiss, and George Spanos and supervised by Melissa Hodgman.\xa0 The SEC's litigation will be conducted by Mr. Cave, Dean M.

['Litigation Release No. 24094 / April 4, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Westchester, New York-based investment adviser with fraud stemming from lies to retail investors about the value of their investments in a Ponzi-like scheme. The SEC alleges that, starting in approximately 2010, Michael Scronic began to raise money from at least 42 friends and acquaintances, many of whom were from his suburban community, in order to invest in a risky options trading strategy.  He allegedly lured investors by informing them that he had a long and impressive track record of proven returns.  He also allegedly lied to investors about the liquidity of investments, telling one investor that "what\'s cool about my fund is that i\'m [sic] only in publicly traded options and cash so any redemptions are met within 2 business days so if you do need to withdraw for your business needs it will be quick and painless."  However, the SEC alleges that Scronic was actually hemorrhaging investor money through massive trading losses, with at least $15 million in investment losses since April 2010.  For the period ending June 30, 2017, Scronic allegedly reported to investors total assets of at least $21,837,475.  However, the balance in his brokerage account on June 30, 2017 was just under $27,500. According to the SEC\'s complaint, when certain investors attempted to redeem their investments, Scronic did not disclose his inability to repay them. Rather, he allegedly provided investors with a steady stream of implausible excuses for why he could not pay them back. In other instances, Scronic sought to obtain additional investment funds from new and existing investors in order to satisfy redemption requests from other investors.  The SEC also alleges that Scronic began identifying himself as an investment adviser to a fictitious hedge fund in which he purported to sell interests, or "shares." In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Scronic. The SEC\'s complaint charges Scronic with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, the SEC alleges that Shane P. Fleming, a former vice president of sales at Life Time Fitness, learned of the merger discussions on or before Feb. 23, 2015 and tipped his friend and business partner Bret J. Beshey with the understanding that Beshey would use the information to make a profit and split those profits with Fleming.  The SEC alleges that rather than trade in his own name, Beshey tipped his friends Christopher M. Bonvissuto and Peter A. Kourtis with the understanding that both men would kick back a portion of their trading proceeds to Beshey.  According to the SEC's complaint, Kourtis tipped his friends Alexander T. Carlucci, Dimitri A. Kandalepas, Austin C. Mansur, and Eric L. Weller, and asked Carlucci, Mansur, and Weller to give him a portion of any profits they made from trading on the information, which they agreed to do. The SEC alleges that the six traders purchased a total of approximately 2,000 highly speculative out-of-the-money call options for Life Time Fitness shares and sold those options for profits of approximately $866,209 shortly after a newspaper reported that Life Time Fitness was in advanced merger discussions with two private equity firms.  According to the SEC's complaint, Bonvissuto and Kourtis shared a portion of their profits with Beshey, who gave approximately $10,000 in cash to Fleming.  The SEC also alleges that Carlucci and Mansur paid cash kickbacks to Kourtis, and that Weller gave Kourtis at least 10 pounds of marijuana as a kickback.

["Joseph Meli has been sentenced by a federal court in Manhattan to more than six years in prison in connection with a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme involving purported resales of tickets to popular concerts and Broadway shows.  The criminal case arises from the same conduct alleged in two Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions filed against Meli in 2017. Meli was arrested in January 2017 and later pleaded guilty to securities fraud.  In connection with his plea, Meli admitted to raising millions of dollars from investors including by providing some investors with fake agreements containing fraudulent signatures that claimed to show Meli's company had agreements with various production and management companies to purchase large blocks of tickets.  On April 3, 2018, a federal court sentenced Meli to 78 months' imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay forfeiture in the amount of $104,765,565 and restitution in an amount to be finalized at a later date. In 2017, the SEC filed two enforcement actions against Meli in federal district court in Manhattan.  In the first action, the SEC alleged that Meli and his co-defendants solicited investments for the bulk purchase and resale of tickets to popular Broadway shows and concerts, but used the majority of the more than $97 million raised to make payments to earlier investors and to enrich Meli, his family, and a co-defendant.  On April 26, 2017, the court entered a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against Meli and his co-defendants in that matter.  In the second action, the SEC alleged that Meli and New York sports radio personality Craig Carton raised millions from investors by falsely claiming that they had access to large blocks of face-value tickets to popular concert performances.  Instead of purchasing tickets for resale, Carton and Meli allegedly misappropriated at least $3.6 million to repay earlier investors and to cover other expenses, including Carton's gambling debts.  Both SEC actions charge Meli and his co-defendants with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the SEC\'s complaint, Pocklington and his attorney, Lantson E. Eldred, structured the ownership of The Eye Machine to conceal Pocklington\'s role with the company and held Eldred out as the company\'s "visual front."  In the offerings, Pocklington, Eldred, and The Eye Machine allegedly failed to disclose Pocklington\'s checkered history and involvement, and misrepresented how investor funds would be spent.  Pocklington allegedly misappropriated over $600,000 of investor funds for personal use, including funding his gold mining companies and paying personal legal and credit card bills.  The complaint also alleges that The Eye Machine paid millions of dollars in undisclosed and excessive sales commissions to defendants Yolanda C. Velazquez, Vanessa Puleo, and Robert A. Vanetten, who acted as unregistered brokers for the company.  According to the complaint, Velazquez - whom the SEC previously barred from acting as a broker-dealer - and Puleo used "boiler room" operations in Florida to "cold call" investors. The Commission\'s complaint, filed in federal court in California, charges: (i) The Eye Machine, Pocklington, Eldred, Velazquez, Puleo, and Vanetten with violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"); (ii) The Eye Machine, AMC Holdings, Pocklington, and Eldred with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; (iii) Walton with violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act; (iv) The Eye Machine, AMC Holdings, and Pocklington with violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act; (v) The Eye Machine, Pocklington, and Eldred with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; (vi) Pocklington and Eldred with aiding and abetting The Eye Machine\'s primary violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5; (vii) Pocklington as the control person of The Eye Machine under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for The Eye Machine\'s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (viii) Velazquez, Puleo, and Vanetten with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and (ix) Velazquez with violating Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement and interest, and penalties.  The complaint also names Eva S. Pocklington, DTR Holdings, LLC, Cobra Chemical, LLC, and Gold Star Resources, LLC as relief defendants. The SEC\'s investigation was conducted by Kathryn C. Wanner and Maria Rodriguez and supervised by Victoria A. Levin of the SEC\'s Los Angeles Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Douglas M. Miller and supervised by Amy J. Longo.']

The complaint against Ikokwu and his companies further alleged that in exchange for persuading clients to invest in FutureGen, Ikokwu received undisclosed "kickbacks" of over $100,000 from FutureGen.  He also allegedly told investors that he conducted extensive due diligence into FutureGen prior to making his recommendation, when, in reality, he did little or no research on the company.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Ikokwu falsely touted the performance of his own family\'s investments with Schmidt to clients. The court entered the final judgment, by consent, against Ikokwu and his companies, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $169,311.64 plus prejudgment interest of $6,869.93.

On April 3, 2018, the court separately entered an order approving a settlement agreement between the   and Ikokwu, under which Ikokwu agreed to repay an additional $64,796.43 for distribution back to injured investors.']

They spent the stolen $6 million on personal expenses such as cars, family vacations, repayment of mortgage and credit-card debt, luxury goods, clothing, entertainment, educational expenses for family members, and a luxury suite at a football stadium.

['On April 5, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New York resident with tipping his brother and father with material nonpublic information about an upcoming corporate acquisition. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that, in 2014, Saverio J. Barbera ("Barbera"), learned that Owens & Minor, Inc., a Virginia-based healthcare logistics company, was going to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Medical Action Industries, Inc. ("Medical Action"), a Brentwood, New York, medical products supplier.  According to the complaint, Barbera then told his father and brother that they should purchase Medical Action stock in advance of the acquisition so that they could profit from the deal.  The SEC alleges that Barbera obtained the information that he tipped to his father and brother from his close friend, the Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Medical Action.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, soon after receiving this tip and less than a week before the public announcement of the deal, Barbera\'s father and brother purchased a combined total of 22,000 shares of Medical Action common stock, which they then sold at a profit following the deal\'s announcement.  The SEC alleges that, as a result of their trading, Barbera\'s father and brother realized combined trading profits of approximately $145,000. Barbera has agreed to settle the SEC\'s charges by paying a penalty of $289,650.72, an amount which is twice the trading profits of his father and brother.

['Litigation Release No. 24108 / April 11, 2018']
["On September 28, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged three New York-based brokers with making unsuitable recommendations that resulted in substantial losses to customers and hefty commissions for the brokers.  One of the brokers agreed to pay more than $400,000 to settle the charges. Brokers must make recommendations that are compatible with their customers' financial needs, investment objectives, and risk tolerances.  An SEC examination of the firm Alexander Capital L.P. detected potential misconduct among certain brokers, and the ensuing investigation has led to the filing of an SEC complaint against William C. Gennity and Rocco Roveccio.  The SEC also issued an order against Laurence M. Torres. The SEC's complaint alleges that Gennity and Roveccio recommended investments that involved frequent buying and selling of securities without any reasonable basis to believe their customers would profit.  According to the complaint, since customers incur costs with every transaction, the price of the security must increase significantly during the brief period it is held in an account for even a minimal profit to be realized. The SEC further alleges that Gennity and Roveccio churned customer accounts, engaged in unauthorized trading, and concealed material information from their customers - namely that the transaction costs associated with their recommendations (commissions, markups, markdowns, postage, fees, and margin interest) would almost certainly outstrip any potential monetary gains in the accounts.  According to the SEC's complaint, customer losses totaled $683,038 while Gennity and Roveccio received approximately $280,000 and $206,000, respectively, in commissions and fees. The SEC's order against Torres finds that he had no reasonable basis to believe it was suitable to recommend a high-cost pattern of frequent trading that gave his customers virtually no chance of making even a minimal profit.  Torres also engaged in churning and made unauthorized trades.  Without admitting or denying the findings, Torres agreed to be barred from the securities industry and penny stock trading, and he must pay $225,359.36 in disgorgement plus $25,748.02 in interest, and a $160,000 penalty. The SEC's litigation against Gennity and Roveccio will proceed in federal district court in Manhattan, with the complaint charging them with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

The SEC\'s complaint alleges that, from 2010 to 2017, Clifton E. Stanley ran a Ponzi scheme through his retirement planning and real estate investment business, The Lifepay Group, LLC.  Stanley is alleged to have lured at least thirty elderly victims to invest approximately $2.4 million of their retirement savings with baseless promises and claims of outsized investment returns.  He kept the scheme afloat for years by paying early investors with later investors\' funds and by convincing investors to roll over their investments.  The SEC further alleges that Stanley pilfered from the estate of an elderly woman\'s family trust, diverting nearly $100,000 to fund the Lifepay Ponzi scheme.  In addition, the SEC\'s complaint alleges that, beginning in 2015, Stanley and Michael E. Watts orchestrated a second offering fraud through a company they controlled, SMDRE, LLC.  Stanley and Watts allegedly used a collection of misrepresentations and empty promises to convince a group of predominantly elderly victims to invest roughly $1.4 million in SMDRE. Stanley is alleged to have used roughly $1.3 million of the Lifepay offering proceeds for personal expenses, including country club memberships, daily living expenses, travel, and entertainment expenses.  In addition, Watts and Stanley allegedly engaged in shell game transactions so they could use the vast majority of SMDRE investor funds for personal expenses and to keep the Lifepay Ponzi scheme afloat.

The SEC alleges that Amro Izzelden "Andy" Altahawi, Dorababu Penumarthi, and Suresh Tammineedi then illegally sold large blocks of their restricted Longfin shares to the public while the stock price was highly elevated. Through their sales, Altahawi, Penumarthi, and Tammineedi collectively reaped more than $27 million in profits. According to the SEC\'s complaint, Longfin\'s founding CEO and controlling shareholder, Venkata Meenavalli, caused the company to issue more than two million unregistered, restricted shares to Altahawi, who was the corporate secretary and a director of Longfin, and tens of thousands of restricted shares to two other affiliated individuals, Penumarthi and Tammineedi, who were allegedly acting as nominees for Meenavalli.

The SEC\'s complaint alleged that the brokers misrepresented the CMOs to their customers as safe, secure, liquid investments that guaranteed by the United States government and suitable for retirees, retirement accounts, and investors with conservative investment goals.

["On April 18, 2018, a federal court entered judgments against former Dewey & LeBoeuf, LLP executives Stephen DiCarmine and Joel Sanders in an SEC enforcement action arising from their roles in a fraudulent $150 million bond offering. In 2014, the SEC filed suit against DiCarmine, Sanders, and others in federal district court in Manhattan.  The SEC's complaint alleged that in 2008 and 2009, Sanders, then the chief financial officer of Dewey & LeBoeuf, in conjunction with other employees, devised a scheme, and directed his staff, to materially falsify the firm's financial statements in order to meet lender covenants.  The SEC further alleged that DiCarmine, the firm's executive director, was aware of these efforts.  In March 2010, Dewey & LeBoeuf conducted a $150 million private placement of bonds.  According to the SEC's complaint, Sanders defrauded investors in that offering by, among other things, providing a private placement memorandum to investors that incorporated the fraudulent financial statements.  The SEC further alleged that Sanders and DiCarmine participated in a conference call where the firm's false financial information was provided to investors. Sanders consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  The judgment against Sanders also provides that the payment of disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties will be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the Commission. DiCarmine consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

The SEC also alleges that the insiders along with the CEO\'s close friend manipulated the company\'s publicly trading stock, and the CEO and his friend kept about $400,000 for themselves. As alleged in the SEC\'s complaint, PixarBio Corporation, its founder and CEO Frank Reynolds, and employee Kenneth Stromsland misled investors with false claims about PixarBio\'s progress in developing "NeuroRelease," a purported method of delivering non-opiate, post-operative pain medication. From December 2015 to the present, the defendants are alleged to have falsely told investors that the FDA had lowered PixarBio\'s hurdles for regulatory approval.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on April 30, 2018, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a default judgment in an ongoing enforcement action against Christopher R. Esposito, the owner and Managing Director of Lionshare Ventures, LLC (Lionshare), in a case involving an alleged scheme to defraud investors by misappropriating investor funds and concealing the ownership and control of a publicly traded company.  The court also entered a final judgement by consent on December 11, 2017, against another defendant in the case, Rene Galizio. The SEC's  , filed on May 26, 2016, alleged a two-part scheme involving Esposito, Lionshare, and several co-defendants.  First, Esposito raised more than $550,000 in investor funds through an unregistered offering of Lionshare securities and then misappropriated $375,000 for his personal benefit.  According to the complaint, Esposito spent almost $300,000 of the funds raised on personal expenses and used $75,000 to acquire control of a Massachusetts-based, publicly traded company, Cannabiz Mobile, Inc., by purchasing all of its convertible debt. In the second phase of the scheme, the SEC's complaint alleged that Esposito and Lionshare, together with co-defendant Anthony Jay Pignatello of Manhattan Beach, California, concealed Esposito and Lionshare's de facto control of Cannabiz and a large percentage of Cannabiz's securities in order to evade SEC Rule 144, which limits securities sales by certain company affiliates, such as control persons.  Esposito allegedly did this by, among other things, installing co-defendant James Gondolfe as the sole officer and director of Cannabiz - even though Esposito and Lionshare secretly controlled the company - to make false statements in Cannabiz's public filings with the SEC and other documents.  According to the SEC's complaint, Esposito paid third-party stock promoters to tout Cannabiz stock in order to increase its price and trading volume.  Both during and after this promotional campaign, Esposito sold significant amounts of Cannabiz convertible debt to others for a profit of almost $304,000.  Esposito, Pignatello, and Galizio also allegedly sold millions of shares of Cannabiz stock directly into the public market for a profit. The final judgment, which was entered against Esposito by default by the Honorable Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, enjoins Esposito from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment also orders Esposito to pay, on a joint and several basis with Lionshare, disgorgement and pre-judgment interest in the total amount of $1,107,413 and a civil penalty of $160,000.  Additionally, the final judgment against Esposito bars him from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and permanently bars him from participating in an offering of a penny stock.

The SEC's complaint alleged that more than 400 investors were attracted to the funds by promises that profits from mortgage investments would yield annual returns of 7.5 percent or more.  In reality, Feathers operated a Ponzi-like scheme by paying returns to investors that came partly from fund profits and partly from other investors.  On August 16, 2013, the SEC obtained summary judgment against Feathers and on November 6, 2013, the court entered a final judgment against Feathers, permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay disgorgement in the amount of $7,782,961 and a $10,000 civil penalty. On October 29, 2014, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California announced the return of an indictment against Feathers, charging him with seventeen counts of securities fraud and twelve counts of mail fraud in connection with Feathers' management and operation of Small Business Capital and the funds it managed.  On December 20, 2017, Feathers pled guilty to one count of mail fraud. The SEC's litigation was led by John B. Bulgozdy and Lynn Dean."]

["On May 1, 2018 a federal court in Jackson, Mississippi unsealed the Commission's previously filed fraud charges against a Mississippi company and its principal who allegedly bilked at least 150 investors in an $85 million Ponzi scheme.  The defendants agreed to permanent injunctions, an asset freeze, and expedited discovery. The SEC's complaint alleges that Arthur Lamar Adams lied to investors by telling them that their money would be used by his company, Madison Timber Properties, LLC, to secure harvest timber rights from various land owners located in Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi, and promised annual returns of 12-15%.  But Madison Timber never obtained any harvesting rights.  Instead, Adams allegedly forged deeds and cutting agreements as well as documents purportedly reflecting the value of the timber on the land.  Adams also allegedly paid early investors with later investors' funds and convinced investors to roll over their investments.  According to the complaint, Adams used investors' money for personal expenses and to develop an unrelated real estate project. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi yesterday also announced criminal charges against Adams. The SEC's complaint, filed under seal in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi on April 20, 2018 and unsealed yesterday, charges Adams and Madison Timber Properties with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, i.e. Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and permanently enjoined Madison Timber and Adams from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered Adams to surrender his passport.  Adams and Madison Timber consented to the entry of the court order.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Marin and Spierdowis.

According to the complaint, Down solicited investments in The Falls by making presentations to groups of professionals during continuing education seminars that he sponsored.  In his presentations, Down represented that some or all of the event centers were and continued to be profitable.  The complaint alleges that certain of these representations to investors were untrue. According to the complaint, from the first half of 2016 forward, members of The Falls' executive team informed Down that the event centers were not profitable.  In addition, they informed Down that his event center model was unsustainable because of the millions of dollars owed to investors and to the event center mortgage holders. In addition, The Falls' own accounting records, which Down received regularly from the Falls' CFO, indicate that, from inception through September 2017, the event centers were never profitable. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, The Falls and Down have consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Down has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott Frost, Alison Okinaka and Cheryl Mori of the Salt Lake Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Amy Oliver and Daniel Wadley."]

In one press release, Stanz allegedly described Chong as a "partner," and in a subsequent blog post, he described the purported licensing agreement as a "crowning achievement."  The agreement never materialized, and the defendants allegedly knew at the time that, in light of Bud Genius\'s weak financial position, it was extremely unlikely that an agreement would ever be reached.

['Litigation Release No. 24159 / June 6, 2018']
["The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on May 21, 2018, a jury in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts convicted Jehu Hand, a licensed attorney in California, of securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit those offenses in connection with two pump-and-dump schemes that defrauded investors in Greenway Technology, a Las Vegas, Nevada-based company purporting to develop resorts for gay and lesbian travelers, and a second company, Crown Marketing.  He will be sentenced by the court at a later date. The allegations regarding Greenway Technology in the criminal indictment against Hand stem from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's complaint against him.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on December 10, 2015, Hand facilitated a scheme to pump and dump Greenway's stock by authoring false legal opinion letters that were designed to evade restrictions on stock sales by company insiders and clear the way for Greenway stock held by him and other scheme participants to be sold to unsuspecting investors in the market.  According to the complaint, Hand and his co-schemers secretly planned and orchestrated the sale of Greenway stock to the public without proper securities registration statements and at prices artificially inflated by news releases, promotional materials, or blast e-mails containing false, exaggerated or misleading information, and by engaging in undisclosed coordinated trading of the stock. These efforts were designed to generate the appearance of demand for the stock and to increase its price even though Greenway had no operations or assets at the time.  According to the complaint, between August 2012 and January 2013, after the stock price had been pumped, the participants in the scheme sold more than 12 million net shares of Greenway stock, causing losses to the investing public of more than $850,000. The SEC's action against Hand, which is pending, seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and penalties as well as a penny stock bar and permanent injunctions against further violations of the securities laws.

After allegedly gaining their trust, he encouraged them to invest with him by falsely promising guaranteed returns of between 10% and 30% from investments he would make on their behalf in the S&P 500 and other unspecified investment vehicles.  Some investors allegedly withdrew money from their life insurance policy or retirement accounts to fund their investment with Hocker.  In fact, Hocker did not invest any of the investors' funds.  Instead, he pocketed the money and used it for his personal living expenses such as credit card bills and to make payments to other investors.  Over the last five years, Hocker raised approximately $1.27 million from about 25 investors.  The investors were largely elderly retirees or individuals nearing retirement, without significant investment experience.

['Court Enters Final Judgment Against Board Chairman Charged with Lying to Auditors']
['Litigation Release No. 24174 / June 22, 2018']
["On June 19, 2018, a federal court entered a final judgment against Stephen B. Pence, the former chairman and majority shareholder of General Employment Enterprises (GEE), in a case alleging that he misled the company's auditors and investors by concealing his knowledge regarding $2.3 million in missing company cash and several related-party transactions. The SEC's complaint, filed on September 9, 2015 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleged that Pence, who is a former U.S. Attorney and lieutenant governor of Kentucky, misled GEE's investors and auditors after the company discovered that substantially all of its cash - $2.3 million in all - was missing.  As alleged in the complaint, Pence created the impression that he was acting independently as GEE's chairman, when he was in fact a figurehead working on behalf of convicted felon Wilbur Anthony Huff.  According to the complaint, in July 2009, Huff caused GEE to transfer substantially all of its cash to a third party, as part of a criminal scheme masterminded by Huff and an accomplice.  The SEC alleged that Pence subsequently misled GEE's auditors about the missing funds and related-party transactions, and that Pence signed the company's 2009 annual report despite knowing that it included false and misleading statements and omissions. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Pence consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-2 thereunder, ordering him to pay a $200,000 civil penalty, and permanently barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Texas resident James VanBlaricum and six others for running an oil and gas Ponzi scheme. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that VanBlaricum was the driving force behind a company called Texas Energy Mutual, LLC (f/k/a Texas Energy Management).  Because he was a securities fraud recidivist with a history of running fraudulent schemes, the complaint also alleges that VanBlaricum convinced Rodney Pope and Chet Inglis to serve as the face of the company.  Together, they enlisted Robert Gilliam, Matthew Leaverton, William Hill, and Erik Rhodes to solicit investors.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that the defendants raised over $10 million by guaranteeing investment returns and promising investors that their funds would be used to drill oil wells.  Instead, the defendants used investor money for a variety of personal expenditures, including luxury international vacations and wedding expenses. According to the complaint, VanBlaricum created a "special needs" program to keep dissatisfied investors from discovering the fraudulent conduct.  The defendants allegedly lulled investors with cash Ponzi payments that purported to be a return on their investment or rolled over investors from a failed drilling program to a newer one. VanBlaricum, Pope, Inglis, Gilliam, Hill, and Rhodes each agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission is pursuing the same charges against Leaverton.  VanBlaricum, Pope, and Inglis also consented to officer and director bars.  Rhodes agreed to disgorge $33,000 in ill-gotten gains while a federal judge will determine disgorgement and penalties with respect to Hill.  In addition to the SEC action, VanBlaricum, Pope, Inglis, Leaverton, and Gilliam were charged in a parallel criminal case by federal authorities and have each pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 30-84 months, and ordered to pay between $1.8 million and $32 million in restitution.

The final judgment imposes a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, a penalty of $150,000, and permanently bars Weed from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in penny stock offerings. In its  , filed on November 6, 2014, the SEC alleged that Weed helped structure CitySide into a publicly traded company through reverse mergers, created backdated promissory notes and authored false legal opinion letters that enabled two co-conspirators to obtain millions of purportedly unrestricted shares of stock in the company.  The co-conspirators later sold those shares to unsuspecting investors after touting the company with false hype as a budding national leader in the ticket selling industry, realizing illicit proceeds of approximately $3 million. In parallel criminal proceedings, Weed was convicted of criminal charges in May 2016,   to 4 years in prison and 3 years of supervised release and ordered to pay a fine of $100,000 and to forfeit $90,000.  His conviction was upheld in October 2017 by the First Circuit Court of Appeals, and his petition for writ of certiorari was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2018.

According to the SEC\'s order, for more than 10 years, Joseph "Jay" Ludovico and another Cantor Fitzgerald trader used personal checks to pay a portion of their commissions to Adam Mattessich, the firm\'s former global co-head of equities, and another trader.

According to the SECs complaint, Texas-based United Development Funding (UDF) is a family of private and publicly-traded investment funds that deploys investor capital as loans to homebuilders and land developers. UDF allegedly solicited investors by advertising annualized returns of up to 9.75 percent as well as regular distributions. According to the complaint, for almost five years, UDF did not tell investors that it lacked the monthly cashflow at times to cover investor distributions in one of its older funds, UDF III. Instead, to pay these distributions, the newer UDF IV fund loaned money to developers who had also borrowed money from UDF III. Rather than using those funds for development projects that were underwritten by UDF IV, UDF directed the developers to use the loaned money to pay down their older loans from UDF III. In most of these cases, the developer never received the borrowed funds at all, and UDF simply transferred the money between funds so that UDF III could make the distributions to its investors. UDF III, UDF IV, and UDF executives Hollis Greenlaw, Benjamin Wissink, Theodore Etter, and Cara Obert knew or should have known that they had misled investors about the use of funds and the nature and status of loans made to developers. The complaint also alleges that UDF III failed to appropriately impair loans in violation of GAAP, and that UDF IV did not adequately disclose the status of real property within its portfolio.

The complaint charges all defendants with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act and charges Johnson, Drost, Koslow and Waltzer with acting as unregistered broker-dealers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint also charges Johnson as a control person pursuant to Sections 20(a) of the Exchange Act and for committing violations by or through others pursuant to Section 20(b) of the Exchange Act for violations of Sections 15(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder and charges Johnson with aiding and abetting violations of Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 of the Advisers Act.  The SEC seeks civil monetary penalties and disgorgement with prejudgment interest from all defendants, as well as an injunction against future violations.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., a registered broker-dealer, agreed to settle charges that it failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) on the suspicious transactions of independent investment advisers that it terminated from using Schwab to custody their client accounts. To help detect potential violations of the securities laws, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires broker-dealers to report suspicious transactions that occur through their firms.  The SEC's complaint alleges that in 2012 and 2013, Schwab terminated 83 independent investment advisers for engaging in activity that Schwab determined violated its internal policies and presented risk to Schwab or its customers.  The complaint further alleges that at least 47 of the terminated advisers engaged in transactions through Schwab that it knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect were suspicious and required the filing of a SAR.  Schwab failed to file SARs on the suspicious transactions of 37 of these terminated advisers.  Schwab failed to file SARs where it suspected or had reason to suspect that the terminated adviser had engaged in a range of suspicious transactions not involving the outright misappropriation or misuse of client funds, including:  (1) transactions involving possible undisclosed self-dealing or conflicts of interest; (2) charging client accounts excessive advisory fees; (3) potentially fraudulent transactions in client accounts; (4) posing as a client to effect or confirms transactions in the client account; and (5) executing client trades and/or collecting advisory fees without being properly registered as an adviser.  Moreover, Schwab failed to file SARs where it suspected or had reason to suspect that the terminated adviser had misused client funds but the client had not complained. The SEC's complaint charges Schwab with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-8 thereunder.  Schwab has agreed to settle the action by consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a permanent injunction and the payment of a $2.8 million civil penalty."]

["The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former CEO of a New Jersey-based payment processing company and his romantic partner, in an insider trading scheme that leveraged nonpublic information about an impending merger announcement to generate more than $250,000 of illicit profits for the defendants. According to the SEC's complaint, Robert O. Carr provided his longtime girlfriend, Katherine M. Hanratty, with confidential information about a potential acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. by another payment processing company.  In the weeks leading up to the merger announcement, Carr allegedly gave Hanratty $1 million to open a brokerage account and instructed her to use almost all of the funds to purchase Heartland stock.  The SEC alleges that Hanratty followed Carr's instructions, opening the account and purchasing more than 11,000 shares of Heartland stock.  After the merger was announced, Heartland's stock price rose substantially, and Hanratty allegedly sought Carr's advice about when to sell the stock.  Hanratty ultimately liquidated her entire position in a single day, earning substantial profits on the sale.

The SEC also alleges that Colangelo, WealthCFO's operations manager, impersonated one of Bahgat's clients during a telephone call with a broker-dealer holding the client's account and thereby obtained internet access to that account.

['On June 28, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Canadian-based oil and gas company and three of its former top finance executives for their roles in an extensive, multi-year accounting fraud. According to the SEC\'s complaint, the fraud was orchestrated by the company\'s former CFO Todd Takeyasu, former vice president of accounting and reporting Jeffery Curran, and former operations controller Waldemar Grab.\xa0The SEC alleges that they manipulated the company\'s operating expenses in order to lower a key publicly reported metric concerning the cost of oil extraction and processing needed to sell a barrel of oil.\xa0Penn West allegedly created an internal budget target representing the amount it would improperly move in its publicly-reported financial statements and gave the illusion that it was spending less money to get oil of out the ground.\xa0In fact, the SEC alleges, the company historically struggled to keep its operating costs under control, and Takeyasu, Curran, and Grab managed operating expenses to meet the budget target.\xa0According to the SEC\'s complaint, they frequently met this target to the dollar by having the company record large, round number, and unsupported adjusting journal entries.\xa0Within the company, this practice was referred to as "reclass to capital." As alleged in the SEC\'s complaint, Takeyasu and Curran directed the reclass-to-capital practices without ensuring that the accounting entries reconciled with actual capital spending amounts, and Curran and Grab were repeatedly warned by a subordinate accountant that the reclass entries lacked support.\xa0In September 2014, the company publicly reported that it would restate its financial statements from 2012 to the first quarter of 2014 and its historical financial statements and related audit reports could no longer be relied upon.

On July 6, 2018, a jury in federal court in Brooklyn, New York returned a guilty verdict against Glen Mills, Pennsylvania preacher, and former registered representative, Vitaly Korchevsky ("Korchevsky") and former registered representative Vladislav Khalupsky ("Khalupsky") in a criminal trial prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.  The jury convicted the defendants on all counts, including securities fraud.  U.S. District Court Judge Raymond J. Dearie has not yet set a date for sentencing. The Commission previously charged Korchevsky, Khalupsky, and over 30 others with securities fraud for trading on hacked press releases in a civil action commenced on August 10, 2015.  The criminal case is based on the same conduct underlying the SEC\'s action.  The SEC charged that Ukrainian hackers used advanced techniques to hack into newswire services and steal hundreds of corporate earnings releases before the newswires released them publicly.  The SEC charged that the hackers created a secret web-based location to transmit the stolen data to traders in Russia, Ukraine, Cyrpus, France, and three U.S. states, Pennsylvania, New York, and Georgia.  The traders are alleged to have used this nonpublic information in a short window of opportunity to place illicit trades in stocks, options, and other securities, sometimes funneling a portion of their illegal profits to the hackers. To date, the SEC has recovered over $53 million and obtained full injunctive relief from the 13 defendants who have agreed to settlements in that case. In February 2016, the SEC also filed a related complaint charging nine additional defendants for taking part in the hacking scheme, SEC v. Zavodchikov, et al., Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-00845 (D.N.J.).

Douglas Hoskins, who was also named in the SEC's complaint, was convicted on 6 counts of wire fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. The charges upon which Gilbertson and Hoskins were convicted arise from the same conduct alleged by the SEC.  According to  , filed in federal court in Minnesota on October 31, 2016, Gilbertson and another company co-founder, installed their fathers as figurehead executives in order to secretly wield control of the company and issue millions of shares of stock to themselves, family, and friends.  They allegedly later hired one of their friends as CEO.  They allegedly caused the company to enter into an agreement to borrow money from them under generous terms that included extra bonus payments to Gilbertson, and other lenders based on the price of Dakota Plains stock after 20 days of trading following a reverse merger into a company with publicly-traded shares. According to the SEC's complaint, Gilbertson enlisted friends and associates including Douglas Hoskins to choreograph extensive sales and purchases of Dakota Plains stock and cause the price to skyrocket from 30 cents to more than $12 per share during that 20-day period.\xa0 The allegedly inflated stock price obligated Dakota Plains to make bonus payments totaling $32,851,800 to Gilbertson and others.\xa0 After meeting his target to receive the bonus payments, Gilbertson ceased his alleged manipulation efforts.\xa0 The stock price then steadily declined to pennies per share and the company was eventually delisted.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Watkins and his companies defrauded professional athletes and other investors out of millions of dollars by telling them that their investments would be used to support waste-to-energy ventures.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, Watkins spent much of the money he raised to cover personal expenses like alimony, past due taxes and credit card bills, and to make payments to prior investors. The Court ruled that the SEC was entitled to summary judgment on its fraud claims based on several investments made by a former NBA player in promissory notes totaling $2,150,000.  The Court found that, when selling the notes, Watkins (1) misrepresented that he and his companies would use the investor's money for specific projects of their waste-to-energy business; and (2) intended to deceive the investor, in that Watkins, upon receiving the funds, promptly used them to repay another investor and to pay various personal expenses, such as alimony and back taxes. In addition to the claims with respect to the former NBA player, the SEC's complaint alleges that Watkins and his companies defrauded other investors.

['On July 13, 2018, a federal court in New York City entered final judgments against a Manhattan man and three of his companies in connection with a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme involving purported resales of tickets to popular concerts and Broadway shows.  Matthew Harriton, one of two individual defendants named in the SEC\'s complaint, along with three entities affiliated with Harriton, settled with the SEC and collectively agreed to pay more than $8.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. In January 2017, the SEC filed a complaint against defendants Harriton, Joseph Meli, and four of their companies.  The SEC alleged that Meli and Harriton solicited investments for the bulk purchase and resale of tickets to popular Broadway shows and concerts, but used the majority of the funds raised from investors to make payments to earlier investors and to enrich themselves and certain members of Meli\'s family.  On April 26, 2017, the court entered a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against Meli, Harriton, and their companies.  The SEC charged each of the defendants with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Defendants Harriton and 875 Holdings, LLC, and relief defendants MXCU Holdings, LLC and Mash Transactions, LLC agreed to settle with the SEC.  The final judgment entered against Harriton permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and orders him to pay a total of $1,375,785, including disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The final judgment entered against 875 Holdings permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and orders it to pay a total of $6,573,542, including disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  MXCU Holdings and Mash Transactions were charged as relief defendants based on their alleged receipt of misappropriated investor funds.  MXCU Holdings and Mash Transactions were ordered to pay a total of $342,491 and $65,877, respectively, in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. The SEC\'s case is being handled by Dahlia Rin, John McCann, Martin Healey, and Celia Moore of the Boston Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC\'s litigation against Meli and his remaining co-defendants and relief defendants remains ongoing.']

["The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against a Miami-based asset manager accused of perpetuating lies about his portfolio manager's investment performance and assets under management, and for stealing approximately $1 million of client funds. The SEC alleges that John Geraci formed the Meridian Matrix Long Short Equity Fund in 2015, and hired Nicholas Mitsakos and his company, Matrix Capital Markets, as the fund's portfolio manager.  Mitsakos had no assets under management, but falsely claimed that he managed millions of dollars of assets and that he had generated returns of up to 66 percent in preceding years.  Rather than verifying these claims, the complaint alleges that Geraci used Mitsakos' false and unsubstantiated claims to market his fund, and eventually obtained $2 million from investors.  Geraci later learned of Mitsakos' deception, and that he had misappropriated approximately $800,000 of the investors' money, but continued to market the fund and to let Mitsakos trade the clients' assets.  Mitsakos returned approximately $1 million of the funds to Geraci, which Geraci then misappropriated for his own use, telling his clients that Mitsakos had lost all of it. The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Geraci with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

In truth, Oakridge had only provided test batteries to those companies for their consideration for possible future orders.  The defendants also, among other things, misrepresented that Oakridge had received $250,000 in "immediate booked orders" and more than $20 million in "follow on commitments" for its "state-of-the-art" lithium golf cart batteries, and had "existing pipeline orders" of $24 million for its batteries.

['A federal district court in Texas has separately ordered the ex-wife of Chris Faulkner, the self-proclaimed "Frack Master," and one of his friends, to disgorge a total of more than $1.12 million. On July 20, 2018, U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater entered a final judgment against Tamra M. Freedman, Faulkner\'s former spouse, ordering her to disgorge $900,000.  Judge Fitzwater also entered a final judgment against Jetmir Ahmedi on February 21, 2018, ordering Ahmedi to disgorge $222,000.  The SEC named Freedman and Ahmedi as relief defendants to recover ill-gotten gains they received from Faulkner, who the SEC   along with 11 other defendants for their roles in an alleged $80 million oil-and-gas securities fraud scheme.  In settling with the SEC, Freedman and Ahmedi neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC\'s complaint. Since the SEC filed its complaint in June 2016, it has partially settled with six defendants-Parker R. Hallam, Dustin Michael Miller Rodriguez, Beth Handkins, Gilbert Steedley, Patriot Energy, Inc., and Crude Energy, LLC-who each agreed to be enjoined from violating various federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  All six defendants, who neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC\'s complaint, agreed to have the court assess the monetary remedies against them upon future motion by the SEC.  Additionally, on an emergency motion filed by the SEC, the court froze Faulkner\'s assets in August 2017 and placed them and two companies he controlled, defendants Breitling Energy Corp. and Breitling Oil and Gas Corp., under the control of a court-appointed receiver.  The court also preliminarily enjoined Faulkner and the two companies from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. On June 15, 2018, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the Northern District of Texas filed a criminal complaint against Faulkner that alleged, among other things, that Faulkner committed securities fraud, mail fraud, and money laundering. The SEC\'s litigation against Faulkner, Jeremy S. Wagers, and Judson F. (Rick) Hoover is ongoing.  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of various federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties, and bars from serving as officers and directors of public companies.']

["On July 16, 2018, a federal court in Boston, Massachusetts entered final judgment against the former senior director of regulatory affairs for Puma Biotechnology, Inc., who was charged with insider trading ahead of two company announcements regarding cancer drug trials. The SEC alleged that Robert Gadimian pocketed more than $1.1 million in illicit profits by secretly purchasing Puma stock and short-term call options based on nonpublic information that he learned about positive developments in two clinical trials for Puma's cancer drug, neratinib.  Gadimian allegedly bought Puma securities before the results from the first trial were announced in December 2013, and again before the results of the second trial were announced in July 2014. In a parallel case, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts brought criminal insider trading charges against Gadimian for the same conduct alleged in the SEC's Complaint.  Gadimian pleaded guilty, he was ordered to forfeit his illegal profits of $1,161,000, and he was sentenced to 27 months in prison, plus 24 months of supervised release and a $25,000 fine. After pleading guilty, Gadimian agreed to settle the SEC's case.  Under the settlement, which the court approved in the final judgment, Gadimian was permanently enjoined from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and he was held liable for disgorgement of $1,161,000, which was deemed satisfied by the order of forfeiture in the criminal case.

The SEC alleges that Harbour told the investors he would use their money exclusively for revenue-generating businesses, and promised them high annual returns, ranging from 12% to 20%.  Instead, the SEC alleges, Harbour diverted substantial portions of the invested funds for personal purposes that included paying off hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal credit card expenses, such as expenses for private jets, cruises, stays at resorts, and a payment to a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon.  Harbour also allegedly used the investor money to make payments on personal loans and debts he owed to investors in prior business ventures.

Murakami and his two advisory companies settled with the SEC and collectively agreed to pay more than $7.9 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, to be deemed satisfied by a restitution order entered in a related criminal case against Murakami. In May 2017, the SEC filed an enforcement action against Murakami and his advisory entities, MC2 Capital Management, LLC and MC2 Canada Capital Management, LLC.  The SEC alleged that Murakami misappropriated investor funds for business and personal expenses and made approximately $1.3 million in Ponzi-like payments.  The SEC also charged Murakami's former business partner, Avi Chiat.  Chiat allegedly helped Murakami raise money from investors while providing investors with fabricated account statements that grossly overstated investment performance.  The SEC charged Murakami, Chiat, MC2 Capital Management, LLC, and MC2 Canada Capital Management, LLC with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8.

Murakami also admitted to withholding material information regarding the management of a hedge fund, and to providing investors with falsified account statements and tax documentation in an effort to lull them into believing that their investments were safe.

It also seeks an officer and director bar against Christopher Collins.  \n \nThe SEC also announced settled charges against Lauren Zarsky, Cameron Collins girlfriend, and her mother, Dorothy Zarsky, for trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information. Lauren Zarsky and Dorothy Zarsky consented to the entry of final judgments without admitting or denying the charges that they sold their shares of Innate based on tips they received from Cameron Collins. Lauren Zarsky agreed to disgorge her ill-gotten gains of $19,440, plus prejudgment interest of $839, and pay a civil penalty of $19,440.  Dorothy Zarsky agreed to disgorge her ill-gotten gains of $22,600, plus prejudgment interest of $975, and pay a civil penalty of $22,600.

['Litigation Release No. 24232 / August 10, 2018']
["On August 2, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Plandai Biotechnology, Inc., a penny stock company, and its Chairman and CEO with making illegal, unregistered sales of stock to unaccredited investors and with failing to adequately disclose that proceeds from sales of Plandai stock were sent to a private company owned by the CEO. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the Southern District of New York, from November 2013 through January 2015, Plandai, acting through Roger Duffield, made unregistered offers and sales of Plandai common stock to at least two unaccredited and unsophisticated investors.  In addition, although the shares in question had been newly issued and sold directly to the investors by Plandai, Duffield allegedly instructed the investors to wire their payments to a private company that he owned and controlled.  Plandai's annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, misleadingly stated that Plandai had received cash in exchange for the shares, and did not disclose that the proceeds from the sale were actually sent to Duffield's private company.  Although Duffield, through his private company, ultimately paid various Plandai business expenses in amounts approximating the payments that had been received from the investors, Plandai did not accurately and fairly record these transactions in its books and records.  Plandai's failure to properly record these transactions allegedly resulted from its lack of a sufficient system of internal accounting controls. The SEC's complaint charges Plandai and Duffield with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint also charges Plandai with violating, and Duffield aiding and abetting violations of, the reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of and Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.

Cohen and their companies, Equitybuild, Inc. and Equitybuild Finance, LLC, charging them with operating a $135 million offering fraud involving real estate located primarily on Chicago\'s South Side. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that since 2010, the defendants have sold promissory notes to at least 900 investors throughout the country.  The defendants raised these funds by falsely promising safe investments fully secured by income-producing real estate.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, the defendants took 15-30% of investors\' funds as undisclosed fees, hiding the fees by reporting inflated acquisition costs.  The complaint also alleges that, contrary to defendants\' representations, the real estate did not earn enough to pay the double-digit returns promised to investors.  As a result, the defendants could only pay earlier investors by raising funds from unwitting new investors. According to the SEC\'s complaint, the defendants recently admitted in a video recording to earlier investors that the companies are in financial distress, can no longer afford to make payments to investors, and are cutting staff to a "skeleton crew."  Despite these disclosures, the defendants have continued to solicit new investors for various real estate funds, again offering double-digit returns but failing to disclose the companies\' dire financial condition. The SEC\'s complaint charges Jerome H. Cohen, Shaun D. Cohen, Equitybuild, Inc., and Equitybuild Finance, LLC with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The SEC\'s complaint also seeks injunctions against future securities laws violations, disgorgement of the defendants\' ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. On August 17, 2018, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order which, among other things, enjoins the defendants from raising any additional funds from investors.

The complaint alleges that Lesak and Global did not disclose to prospective investors that Lesak had been barred and had his registration suspended by the NASD, or that in 2013 he had pleaded guilty to and been convicted of both securities fraud and wire fraud related to securities transactions.  Prior to March 6, 2017, the defendants did not tell prospective investors that they were being paid thousands of dollars each month - in many instances tens of thousands of dollars - to promote Axiom stock to investors.  According to the complaint, to help create "traffic" in Axiom stock and the appearance of a market for its securities, Lesak personally bought and sold thousands of shares of Axiom stock in hundreds of transactions that made little economic sense and resulted in losses for Lesak.

['Litigation Release No. 24249 / August 29, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against 1 Global Capital LLC and its former chief executive officer for allegedly defrauding at least 3,400 retail investors, more than one-third of whom invested their retirement funds.  The Florida-based cash advance company and former CEO Carl Ruderman allegedly fraudulently raised more than $287 million since 2014 in unregistered securities sold through a network that included barred brokers. On August 23, 2018, the Honorable Judge Beth Bloom of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted the SEC\'s request for a temporary asset freeze against Ruderman and other Ruderman companies charged by the SEC as relief defendants.  The Court also granted the SEC\'s request to appoint a receiver over certain of the relief defendants - Bright Smile Financing, LLC, BRR Block, Inc., Digi South, LLC, Ganador Enterprises, LLC, Media Pay LLC, and Pay Now Direct LLC.  The Court scheduled a hearing for September 7, 2018, for Ruderman and the relief defendants to show cause, if any, why the asset freeze Order should not continue for the pendency of the litigation or until otherwise ordered by the Court. According to the SEC\'s complaint unsealed yesterday, although investors were promised profits from 1 Global\'s loans to small and mid-sized companies, a large portion of their money went to Ruderman\'s lavish personal spending and to his consumer-loan companies, Bright Smile Financing LLC and Ganador Enterprises LLC, which had nothing to do with 1 Global\'s cash advance business.  Investors in 1 Global allegedly were given bogus account statements and were falsely told that it had an independent auditor, and that its secured loans, typically for small amounts, had low default rates. According to the complaint, in contrast to what it told investors, 1 Global marketed itself to business borrowers as a low-hassle way to access cash quickly, often made large, unsecured loans, and had significant problems with collections. 1 Global declared bankruptcy in July and Ruderman resigned from the company. The SEC\'s complaint charges 1 Global and Ruderman with violations of Sections 5(a), (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Action of 1934 ("Exchange Act").  Additionally, the complaint charges Ruderman with aiding and abetting 1 Global\'s violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and with violating Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC seeks disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest from the defendants and relief defendants, and financial penalties against the defendants.

['Litigation Release No. 24260 / September 6, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against a microcap company and its CEO for issuing false and misleading press releases as part of a market manipulation scheme. According to the SEC\'s complaint, In Ovations Holdings, Inc. (ticker: INOH) and its CEO, Mark Goldberg, issued false and misleading press releases as part of a scheme to fraudulently induce investors to buy Ovations stock so that one or more stock promoters could sell their Ovations shares.  For example, as alleged in the complaint, on June 10, 2014, Ovations claimed that it "obtained exclusive rights to market" a "sophisticated sputum cytology technology for early and pre stage detection of lung cancer from . . . an officer and director of INOH."  In fact, according to the complaint Goldberg knew this release was false and misleading because Ovations never provided any funding to the individual under its licensing agreement and that individual never served as an officer or director of Ovations. The United States Attorney\'s Office for the Eastern District of New York announced criminal charges against Goldberg, who was a registered representative associated with ten broker-dealers between 1992 and 2003. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, charges Ovations and Goldberg with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder.

["An attorney charged with penny stock fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year has now been indicted.\xa0 The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced the criminal charges today. The SEC's complaint against Christopher K. Davies, filed April 18, alleges that he fraudulently controlled a penny stock company from behind the scenes and made false statements about its business plans and operations so he could illegally obtain millions of shares, which he planned to profit on by selling into the market.\xa0 The   in July 2016 effectively thwarted the defendant from dumping many of these shares on the market.  Davies allegedly recruited a series of strawmen to serve as CEOs of American Transportation Holdings Inc. (ATHI), which was in fact a shell company with no operations.\xa0 Meanwhile, according to the SEC's complaint, Davies was behind the company's frequent misleading statements about purported business ventures that ranged from home health care and gold trading to transportation services and game development.\xa0 Davies also allegedly orchestrated a series of press releases in June and July 2016, falsely claiming that the company had entered into agreements with a National Indoor Football League.  Following these press releases and a simultaneous promotional campaign, ATHI's share price soared from under a penny to an intraday trading high of $12, causing the market capitalization of this empty shell company to reach nearly $3 billion. According to the SEC's complaint, Davies' scheme included setting up fake email addresses and using forged documents to cause ATHI to issue stock to entities that he and his associates controlled.  ATHI and Davies allegedly also misled a court in Florida to obtain approval for ATHI to issue shares to another company, which then sold the shares for over $100,000 and paid more than $37,000 to one of Davies' companies.  Over the course of his scheme, Davies caused ATHI to issue at least 271 million shares, potentially worth millions of dollars to entities he controlled.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Boulder, Colorado-based biopharmaceutical company, its CEO and its former CFO will pay more than $20 million in penalties to settle charges of misleading investors about the company\'s developmental lung cancer drug. The SEC\'s complaint filed in federal court in Denver alleges that over a four-month period starting in July 2015, Clovis Oncology Inc. and CEO Patrick Mahaffy misled investors about how well Clovis\' flagship lung cancer drug worked compared to another drug.  According to the complaint, the company\'s investor presentations, press releases, and SEC filings stated that the drug was effective 60 percent of the time, far higher than suggested by actual results available internally.  Clovis raised approximately $298 million in a public stock offering in July 2015, and saw its stock price collapse in November 2015 after disclosing that the effectiveness rate was actually 28 percent.  The company stopped development on the drug in May 2016. According to the SEC\'s complaint, in evaluating Clovis\' stock, investors closely followed prospects for its lung cancer drug rociletinib, or Roci, and an important driver was its "efficacy," or how well the drug worked.  In May 2015, Clovis disclosed in an investor presentation that Roci\'s efficacy was 60 percent, meaning that in 60 percent of patients, Roci caused targeted tumors to shrink.  The complaint alleges that soon after, certain data provided to Mahaffy and Erle Mast, the company\'s CFO at that time, showed that Roci\'s efficacy rate was substantially lower and by early July 2015, Mahaffy and Mast learned that the efficacy for Roci at that time was 42 percent.  Clovis continued referring to the 60 percent efficacy figure, including in the solicitation materials for the July 2015 offering and afterward.  In November 2015, after Clovis disclosed the true efficacy, using the methodology required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, its stock price dropped approximately 70 percent. The SEC\'s complaint charges Clovis with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\xa0 The complaint charges Mahaffy with violating Section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting Clovis\' violations of Section 13(a).

Romer, III persuaded at least 30 of his customers, many of whom invested most of their life savings with Romer, to sell securities in their brokerage accounts and transfer the proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC or CoreCap Solutions, LLC.  Romer allegedly represented to his customers that upon transferring the money, he would invest it in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current investments.  Based on Romer's misrepresentations, the customers believed that CoreCap Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with a broker-dealer where he worked.  Romer's alleged statements to his customers were false.  As alleged in the complaint, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer's personal businesses, and Romer did not invest the customers' money in the stock market for their benefit.  He allegedly stole the money and used it to benefit himself and his family, to conduct trading in his own brokerage account, to make Ponzi-like payments to other customers, and to repay customers from his prior brokerage firm who had suffered losses on an investment Romer had recommended. The SEC's complaint, filed in the federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Romer with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Romer to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Marlene Key-Patterson and Wilburn Saylor of the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by Steven Klawans.  The litigation will be led by John E. Birkenheier and Ms. Key-Patterson.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Macomb County, Michigan Prosecutor's Office."]

['The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a hedge fund adviser and his investment advisory firm with illegally profiting from a scheme to drive down the price of San Diego-based Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., reaping more than $1.3 million of gains for the adviser and the hedge fund. The SEC\'s complaint charges that Gregory Lemelson and Massachusetts-based Lemelson Capital Management LLC issued false information about Ligand after Lemelson took a short position in Ligand in May 2014 on behalf of The Amvona Fund, a hedge fund he advised and partly owned. Short-sellers profit when the price of stock declines. According to the SEC\'s complaint, Ligand\'s stock lost more than one-third of its value during the course of Lemelson\'s alleged scheme. After establishing his short position, the complaint charges that Lemelson made a series of false statements to shake investor confidence in Ligand, lower its stock price, and increase the value of his position. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, alleges that Lemelson used written reports, interviews, and social media to spread untrue claims, including that Ligand was "teetering on the brink of bankruptcy" and that Ligand\'s investor relations firm agreed with his view that its flagship Hepatitis C drug, Promacta, was going to become obsolete. Lemelson also allegedly misled investors by citing a European doctor\'s negative views on the same Ligand drug without revealing the doctor was Amvona\'s largest investor and had a significant financial interest in seeing Ligand\'s stock price decline. The SEC\'s complaint charges Lemelson and Lemelson Capital Management with violating the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as violating Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1941 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and seeks to have them return allegedly ill-gotten gains\xa0with interest\xa0and pay monetary penalties.

In separate complaints filed in federal court in Manhattan on Friday, the SEC alleges that Florida resident Emil Botvinnik and New York resident Jovannie Aquino recommended frequent, short-term trades that generated large commissions for the brokers but were almost guaranteed to lose money for their customers. According to the SEC's complaints, Botvinnik's and Aquino's customers - a number of whom were at or near retirement age - lost approximately $3.6 million as a result of the trades while the brokers pocketed approximately $4.6 million in commissions. The complaints also allege that both brokers engaged in unauthorized trading and concealed material information from their customers about the transaction costs associated with their recommendations, which were likely to outstrip any potential monetary gains in the accounts.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Sientra, Inc., a California-based medical aesthetics company, and its former CEO, Hani Zeini, with concealing damaging news about the company\'s sole-source manufacturer before it closed a $60 million stock offering in 2015.  The company agreed to settle the SEC\'s charges. According to the SEC\'s complaint, Sientra sells silicone breast implants in the United States, and at the time of the offering, all of the implants it sold were made by a company in Brazil.  Three days before Sientra was preparing to close a stock offering for more than $60 million, Zeini allegedly learned from the Brazilian company\'s CEO that its Brazilian manufacturer\'s "CE certificate," which is a sign of regulatory compliance required to sell products in the European Union, had been suspended.  Zeini allegedly concealed this information from Sientra\'s general counsel and the underwriters for the offering.  The day after the offering closed, news of the suspension became public, and Sientra\'s stock price fell 52.6% from $20.58 to $9.70 per share after it issued a release disclosing the suspension.  Even after that, Zeini allegedly lied to those asking about the matter, and tried to destroy the records that showed he knew about the CE certificate suspension. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Hani Zeini with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks a penalty, an officer and director bar, and a permanent injunction. Without admitting or denying the findings, Sientra, consented to the entry of the SEC\'s order, which finds Sientra violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Sientra to cease and desist from future violations of these statutes.  In considering whether to accept Sientra\'s settlement the SEC considered Sientra\'s prompt action upon discovering the alleged fraud, self-reporting to the SEC, and extensive cooperation with the agency\'s investigation.

Louisiana against Lafayette, Louisiana-based World Tree Financial, LLC and its majority-owner and co-founder, Wesley Kyle Perkins, for operating a cherry-picking scheme that defrauded World Tree clients. The complaint alleges that for more than four years, Perkins reaped substantial profits at his clients' expense by cherry-picking trades.  Perkins allegedly traded securities in World Tree's omnibus account and delayed allocating the securities to specific client accounts until he had observed the securities' performance over the course of the day.  He then allocated profitable trades to favored accounts, like his own, while allocating unprofitable trades to two accounts with substantial assets controlled by one person.  The complaint also alleges that World Tree and Perkins misrepresented to clients that all trades would be allocated fairly and equitably.  In addition, it is alleged that World Tree, Perkins and Priscilla Gilmore Perkins, Perkins' wife and the firm's co-founder and co-owner, falsely represented that they were not trading in the same securities as World Tree's clients. The SEC's complaint charges World Tree and Perkins with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

['On September 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged San Diego County, California resident Leroy "Lee" Young and his firm, Young Capital Management LLC (YCM), for conducting fraudulent sales of unregistered securities. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that from January 2013 through December 2017, Young and YCM illegally raised at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors through false promises of high returns on their principal investment.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, Young falsely represented that he would use the investors\' money for fees associated with selling bonds or, alternately, for fees associated with launching a hedge fund.  The complaint also alleges that Young falsely told investors that he would pay returns of ten times their principal investment in sixty days, generated from the proceeds of bond or hedge fund offerings.  In reality, according to the complaint, Young spent the investors\' money on personal expenses, and he has not paid returns to investors or repaid their principal investments. Young and YCM admitted the allegations in the complaint and have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, and the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering Young to pay disgorgement of $336,450, prejudgment interest of $18,923, and a civil penalty of $336,450.  The proposed settlement is subject to Court approval.  Based on the anticipated entry of an injunction, Young has agreed to the issuance of an SEC order that permanently bars him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in an offering of a penny stock. The SEC also brought settled administrative proceedings against Michael L. LaPenna and Kentucky-based lawyer Phillip R. Grogan.  According to the SEC\'s orders, LaPenna recruited investors by making material misrepresentations about Young\'s investment program, and Grogan facilitated the transfer of investor funds through his trust account, giving investors the false and misleading impression that their principal was safely escrowed with an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\'s findings, LaPenna agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $22,500, prejudgment interest of $583, and a $22,500 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\'s findings, Grogan agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he caused Young\'s antifraud violations; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $3,050, prejudgment interest of $248, and a $3,050 civil penalty.

The SEC also charged BBSI in the accounting fraud and charged the company\'s former controller for his role in improperly approving certain of the CFO\'s accounting entries. Both BBSI and the former controller agreed to settle the Commission\'s charges against them. The SEC\'s complaint against BBSI\'s former CFO James D. Miller, filed in federal district court in the Western District of Washington, alleges that Miller manipulated BBSI\'s accounting records to hide the fact that its workers\' compensation expense was increasing relative to its revenue. According to the complaint, Miller took steps to conceal from BBSI\'s independent auditor a third-party actuarial report concluding that BBSI needed to add tens of millions of dollars to its workers\' compensation liability. BBSI\'s stock dropped 32 percent when the Vancouver, Washington-based firm announced it needed to restate its financial results to reflect increased workers\' compensation expenses.  The SEC\'s complaint alleges Miller violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), and Rules 10b-5 and 13a-14 thereunder, and Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

In its complaint, filed on May 31, 2016, the SEC\xa0alleged that Hope and Bruton managed two private hedge funds in which their only compensation was an incentive fee, calculated as a share of the profits earned in the funds\' accounts each month. The complaint alleged that Hope and Bruton engaged in a continuous pattern of trading to inflate their incentive fee by structuring trading so that a profit would be realized at the end of the month and guaranteeing that losses would not be realized until the following month.  Many of these trades could not reasonably have been expected to generate a profit for the funds, and thus served solely to generate advisory fees for Hope to the detriment of the funds\' investors.  The scheme allegedly enabled Hope to avoid realizing more than $50 million in losses in the hedge funds while earning millions of dollars in fees to which it was not entitled.  According to the complaint, if Hope and Bruton had not engaged in the scheme, they would have received almost no incentive fees between at least October 2014 and June 2016. The court entered the consent judgment against Hope and Bruton ordering them to pay disgorgement of $1,237,235 and a civil penalty of $250,000.

["The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four individuals and their associated entities with carrying out a long-running and complex fraud on investors in the Melrose Resort on Daufuskie Island, South Carolina. The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that J.T. Bramlette of Salt Lake City was the ringleader of the fraud and arranged for the purchase of the Melrose Resort in 2011.  The other defendants, Anthony Hartman, Travis Kozlowski and Aaron Wernli, helped raised money for the project.  According to the complaint, from at least 2014, investors were promised returns of up to 24% and were encouraged to put their retirement savings in the resort.  In reality, the resort was uninhabitable and was suffering significant losses each month.  The resort was in foreclosure and parts of it were put up for auction for unpaid property taxes.  The defendants lost their ownership in the resort when they defaulted on a series of loans, but continued to raise money from unsuspecting investors without disclosing that they had lost everything.  In addition, Bramlette used a substantial amount of investor funds to pay for his lavish lifestyle, including purchases on Rodeo Drive, and automobiles for friends and family.  Some investor money was also used to make Ponzi-like payments to investors. The SEC's complaint charges Bramlette, Hartman, Kozlowski, Wernli, the Pelorus Group, Private Placement Capital Notes II, LLC, Stone Mountain Equities, LLC and Entelecus Fund, LLC with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.   Bramlette, Hartman, Kozlowski and their associated entities are also charged with violating an antifraud provision of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act.  The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, interest, penalties and permanent injunctions. Wernli, who is cooperating with the SEC's litigation, has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a permanent injunction, including a court order prohibiting him from issuing or selling any security in an unregistered offering, as well as a monetary penalty of $40,000.\xa0 This settlement is subject to court approval.

The complaint alleges that Skelley violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Shah violated Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.

Bates for securities fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws. According to the SEC\'s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas - San Antonio, Bates founded and served as CEO of FWLL, LLC (a/k/a Fourwinds Logistics Laredo) ("FWLL") to buy and sell sand used in hydraulic fracking to produce oil.  The complaint alleges that Uresti, then a licensed attorney and Texas state senator, provided a veneer of credibility to FWLL and served as the company\'s counsel, broker, and escrow agent.  Together, Uresti and Bates allegedly raised over $11 million by misrepresenting the profitability and safety of investments in the FWLL venture, including presenting a doctored bank statement to investors showing that FWLL had over $18 million in cash, when in reality the company had less than $100,000.  According to the complaint, Uresti convinced one of his legal clients, a financially unsophisticated single mother, to invest $900,000, which came from a wrongful death settlement that Uresti had secured on her behalf after the death of two of her children.  Uresti allegedly received large, undisclosed commissions for his solicitations, and Bates spent most of the investors\' money on lavish and improper payments and expenses. The SEC\'s complaint charges both defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

In related criminal proceedings earlier this year, a federal jury found Uresti guilty on 11 felony counts, including two counts of securities fraud, while Bates pleaded guilty to eight felony counts, including securities fraud.

In November 2017, a federal jury convicted Dr. Edward J. Kosinski of Weston, Conn., of two counts of securities fraud. The criminal securities fraud charges arose from the same facts and circumstances alleged in the SEC's complaint, filed on August 4, 2016.  According to the SEC's complaint, Kosinski traded in advance of two negative news announcements by Regado Bioscience.  Kosinski, who served as principal investigator of a drug trial sponsored by Regado, learned that patient enrollment in the trial was being suspended because patients had experienced severe allergic reactions.  He sold all 40,000 shares of his Regado stock the following day to avoid approximately $160,000 in losses when the news became public and the stock price dropped.  A month later, Kosinski learned that enrollment in the trial was going to be halted because a patient had died, and he profited through options trades by betting that Regado's stock price would drop again.

The former CFO, Adam Derbyshire, will pay more than $1 million to settle the charges. According to the SEC's complaints filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Salix and Derbyshire made false statements to analysts and investors during quarterly earnings calls by significantly understating the amount of Salix drugs that wholesaler customers held in inventory.  Salix had engaged in a long-standing practice of flooding the distribution channel by using incentives to induce customers to purchase more products, creating a short-term revenue bump but excess supply that imperiled future sales.  The complaints allege that Salix and Derbyshire also failed to disclose in SEC reports that the practice had impacted earnings and presented a significant risk to Salix investors.  Salix is now a subsidiary of Bausch Health Companies Inc., which was previously known as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.  The alleged misconduct occurred prior to Salix's acquisition by Valeant. To settle the charges, Salix, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, agreed to be enjoined from future violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b) and  13a-13.

The SEC\'s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that in one of the schemes, Craig defrauded an investor of more than $900,000 between 2014 and 2016 and misappropriated over $600,000.  Craig misrepresented that the investor\'s funds would remain in escrow and be used only for the purpose of obtaining a "proof of funds" to purchase a condominium property known as the Heritage Condominiums in Atlanta, Georgia.  Craig also misrepresented that, after the property was purchased, the investor would receive a return of the principal plus a profit of approximately 30% in a short period of time.  Despite these promises, Craig almost immediately transferred these funds to bank accounts that he controlled or to third parties.  The SEC\'s complaint also alleges that Craig encouraged the investor to take out loans to further fund the investment, misrepresenting that Craig would make payments on the loans with his own funds until the real estate transaction closed.  Instead, Craig allegedly used the investor\'s escrowed funds to make the payments. The SEC further alleges that Craig and OneStep engaged in a similar scheme in late 2017.  In this scheme, Craig and OneStep defrauded at least five investors, who were told that their funds were being used for a real estate development project, of $460,000 by guaranteeing high profits and then misappropriating the funds for other purposes. The SEC\'s complaint charges Craig and OneStep with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC\'s complaint seeks a judgment against the defendants providing for permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The complaint also names Peter Baker, Elizabeth Oharriz, Prestige Global Trading, Ltd., and Diversified Initiatives Consulting & Logistics, Inc. as relief defendants, seeking disgorgement with prejudgment interest against them. The SEC\'s investigation is led by Christina McGill and Matthew B. Reisig, with assistance from Richard G. Lill, and is supervised by Timothy England and Melissa Hodgman.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 10, 2018, Robert O. Carr, the former CEO of Heartland Payment Systems, Inc., provided his longtime girlfriend, Katherine M. Hanratty, with confidential information about a potential acquisition of his company by another payment processing company.  In the weeks leading up to the merger announcement, Carr allegedly gave Hanratty $1 million to open a brokerage account and instructed her to use almost all of the funds to purchase Heartland stock.  The SEC alleged that Hanratty followed Carr's instructions, opening the account and purchasing more than 11,000 shares of Heartland stock.  After the merger was announced, Heartland's stock price rose substantially, and Hanratty allegedly sought Carr's advice about when to sell the stock.  Hanratty ultimately liquidated her entire position in a single day, earning substantial profits on the sale. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hanratty consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders her to pay $277,980 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest as well $250,628 as a penalty.

As alleged in the SEC's complaint, over at least a four year period, Todd Elliott Hitt used two of his companies - Kiddar Capital LLC and Kiddar Group Holdings, Inc. - to raise more than $20 million from investors for the purpose of acquiring and operating the Silver Line office building, new home construction in Northern Virginia, and a fund managed by Hitt that invested in a start-up business.  The SEC alleges that Hitt made misrepresentations about his own investments in the ventures and misappropriated several million dollars of investor funds to support his extravagant lifestyle and make Ponzi-like payments to prior investors. As part of his settlement with the SEC, the terms of which remain subject to court approval, Hitt consented to entry of a judgment freezing his assets and imposing conduct-based injunctions that enjoin him from participating in the offer or sale of interests in real estate development companies.  Hitt has also consented to the appointment of a receiver over a number of the corporate defendants and relief defendants.  Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the Receiver would protect investors, prevent asset dissipation and loss, and attend to the businesses.  Penalties and disgorgement would be determined by the court at a later date. The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, charges Hitt, Kiddar Capital, and Kiddar Group with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and also charges Hitt with violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

After Cherubim\'s stock price and trading volume increased on this news, certain individuals associated with the company may have "dumped" their overvalued Cherubim stock for significant profits. As part of its investigation, the SEC issued subpoenas to St. James Trust and James in June 2018.

The SEC\'s complaint alleges that Bryan B. Long, a CPA who was employed as eBay\'s Director of SEC Reporting, obtained material non-public information about PayPal\'s impending acquisition of Xoom in the course of his work preparing PayPal\'s SEC filings.  According to the complaint, Long purchased Xoom call options in late May 2015 shortly after PayPal made its initial acquisition offer.  Approximately one month later, after learning that the deal was moving forward and could be announced in "early July," Long allegedly engaged in a second round of illegal trades, purchasing additional Xoom call options that were due to expire in less than a month.  As alleged in the complaint, Long reaped almost $36,000 in ill-gotten gains by selling all of the options after PayPal announced it was acquiring Xoom on July 1, 2015. The SEC\'s complaint, filed in federal district court in the Northern District of California, charges Long with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, pre-judgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.

According to the complaints, the marketers\' internet video advertisements, which were disseminated through spam emails, used actors to portray ordinary people who became millionaires by trading binary options. The videos staged fake demonstrations of supposed software users watching their account balances grow in real time. The SEC alleges that the software was simply a ruse to persuade investors to open accounts with the brokers. The SEC\'s complaints charged 10 individuals and two companies involved in the fraudulent marketing campaigns. The SEC alleged that Timothy Atkinson, All In Publishing, LLC, Ronald Montano, Antonio Giacca, Travis Stephenson, Grayson Brookshire, and Justin Blake Barrett violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act").  The SEC also alleged that Jay Passerino violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act.  The SEC further alleged that all of these defendants aided and abetted each other\'s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.  In addition, the SEC alleged that Atkinson and Montano each violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder through or by the means of the other defendants, in violation of Section 20(b) of the Exchange Act, and that Atkinson is liable under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as a control person for the violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by All In Publishing, LLC.  Finally, the SEC alleged that William Berry, Berry Mediaworks,LLC, Shmuel Pollen, and Michael Wright aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act by Atkinson, Passerino, All In Publishing, LLC, Giacca, Montano and Stephenson.

['SEC Files Charges in Municipal Bond "Flipping" and Kickback Schemes']
['Litigation Release No. 24337 / November 7, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission charged two firms and 18 individuals in a scheme to improperly divert new issue municipal bonds to broker-dealers at the expense of retail investors.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, the defendants - known in the industry as "flippers" - purchased new issue municipal bonds, often by posing as retail investors to gain priority in bond allocations.  The defendants then "flipped" the bonds to broker-dealers for a fee. The SEC also charged a municipal underwriter for accepting kickbacks from one of the flippers. The SEC alleges that from at least 2009 to 2016, Core Performance Management LLC ("CPM"), RMR Asset Management Co. ("RMR"), their principals, and certain of their associates, misrepresented their identities to gain priority in new issue municipal bond allocations.  Municipal issuers typically require underwriters to give retail investor orders the highest priority when allocating new issue bonds, particularly retail investors within the municipal issuer\'s jurisdiction.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, these defendants used fictitious business names, falsely linked their orders to ZIP codes within the issuer\'s jurisdiction, and split orders among dozens of accounts.  After acquiring the bonds, the SEC alleges that the defendants quickly resold them to broker-dealers, typically for a fixed, pre-arranged commission, and often sought to hide the flipping activity from issuers and underwriters by manipulating sales tickets. The SEC alleges that CPM, its principal James P. Scherr, and associates Deborah B. Dora, Sharlene F. Mesite, and Anadel R. Pinzon violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that CPM and Dora also aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; that Scherr and CPM violated Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"); that CPM, Scherr, Dora, Mesite, Pinzon, and associate James J. O\'Neil violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act; that CPM, Dora, Mesite, Pinzon, and Scherr violated Rule G-17 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB"); and that Scherr is liable as a control person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for CPM\'s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the SEC alleges that RMR, its principal Ralph M. Riccardi, and associates Bruce A. Broekhuizen, Douglas J. Derryberry, David R. Frost, Neil P. Kelly, John M. Kirschenbaum, Timothy J. McAloon, Jocelyn M. Murphy, Dewey T. Tran, and Philip A. Weiner violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that RMR, Riccardi, Frost, and Kirschenbaum also aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; that RMR, Riccardi, Broekhuizen, Derryberry, Frost, Kelly, Kirschenbaum, McAloon, Murphy, Tran, and Weiner, as well as associates Richard C. Gounaud, David S. Luttbeg, Michael S. Murphy violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act; and that RMR, Broekhuizen, Derryberry, Frost, Kelly, Kirschenbaum, McAloon, Jocelyn Murphy, Riccardi, Tran, and Weiner violated MSRB Rule G-17. CPM, Scherr, Dora, Mesite, O\'Neil, and Pinzon settled the SEC\'s charges without admitting or denying the allegations, agreeing to injunctions, to return allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties, be subject to industry bars or suspensions, and to cooperate with the SEC\'s ongoing investigation.  In addition, RMR, Riccardi, Broekhuizen, Derryberry, Frost, Kelly, Kirschenbaum, Luttbeg, McAloon, Tran, and Weiner settled the SEC\'s charges without admitting or denying the allegations, agreeing to injunctions, to return allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties, be subject to industry bars or suspensions, and to cooperate with the SEC\'s ongoing investigation. The settlements are subject to court approval.  The SEC\'s charges against RMR associates Gounaud and the Murphys will be litigated in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. In a related action, the SEC instituted settled proceedings against Charles Kerry Morris, the former head of municipal underwriting at broker-dealer NW Capital Markets Inc.  The SEC found that Morris took kickbacks from Scherr and engaged in a parking scheme in which Morris allocated new issue bonds to Scherr with the understanding that Morris would repurchase them.  As a result of this trading, the SEC found that Morris and NW Capital caused Scherr and Core Performance\'s improper unregistered broker activity.  Specifically, the SEC found that Morris willfully violated Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, MSRB Rule G-17, and caused violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC also found that NW Capital willfully violated MSRB Rule G-17, Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, and caused violations of Sections 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC found that Morris\'s supervisor, James A. Fagan, failed reasonably to supervise Morris\'s activities within the meaning of Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, incorporating Section 15(b)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act, and willfully violated MSRB Rule G-27. Morris, NW Capital, and Fagan agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the SEC\'s findings. Morris agreed to pay a total of $254,009 and to consent to an industry bar.  NW Capital agreed to be censured and pay a total of $87,065 and Fagan agreed to pay a $10,000 penalty and to consent to a six-month supervisory suspension. The investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by the Division of Enforcement\'s Public Finance Abuse Unit, including Joseph Chimienti, Laura Cunningham, Warren Greth, Cori Shepherd, and Jonathan Wilcox, with assistance from Deputy Unit Chief Mark Zehner and litigation counsel Nicholas Pilgrim.  Kevin Guerrero and Ivonia Slade supervised the investigation.  Mr. Pilgrim will lead the litigation against Gounaud, Jocelyn Murphy, and Michael Murphy.']

The SEC alleges that the Tandons often instructed SeeThru analysts to use different, higher price targets for covered issuers than those yielded through purported quantitative analysis, and the price targets contained in SeeThru\'s reports were typically more than 300 percent above the current trading price of the stock. The SEC further alleges that Ajay Tandon, who serves as CEO, frequently traded in the same stocks that SeeThru was evaluating despite stating in published interviews and elsewhere that neither the firm nor its principals traded in securities for which they published research.\xa0 According to the SEC\'s complaint, Tandon also engaged in scalping, which is a form of securities fraud that occurs when a perpetrator makes a stock recommendation to investors and contemporaneously trades against that very recommendation in the open market without adequate disclosure.

['Litigation Release No. 24345 / November 8, 2018']
['The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged an individual and seven corporate entities that he controlled with defrauding investors through the promotion and operation of a multimillion dollar Ponzi and pyramid scheme. The SEC alleges that Eric J. "EJ" Dalius, who pled guilty in 2001 to criminal charges in connection with a long distance phone card scam, and the companies he controlled under the umbrella name "Saivian," sold securities that entitled holders to receive 20% cash back on their shopping purchases in exchange for paying a fee of $125 every 28 days, and submission of receipts.  Dalius and the Saivian companies falsely claimed that Saivian funded its cash back payments to members by monetizing the point-of-sale receipt data submitted by its members.  Instead, they satisfied promised returns to some investors through the investments of others rather than through legitimate business activity.  Dalius and his companies also allegedly promised a daily residual income stream for affiliates who sold Saivian memberships to downline recruits.  The SEC also alleges that Dalius hid his creation and ownership of the Saivian scheme and failed to disclose his 2001 criminal conviction in connection with the earlier multi-level marketing fraud. According to the SEC, Dalius stole a large portion of the more than $165 million generated by the scheme through investor contributions and the accumulation in value of Bitcoin that investors paid Dalius to purchase memberships.  The SEC alleges that Dalius used Saivian investor contributions to fund personal investment accounts with tens of millions of dollars and to purchase private jet travel, luxury vacations, sports and entertainment tickets, multimillion dollar properties in Miami Beach and New York City, and an exotic sports car. The SEC\'s complaint, filed under seal in federal court in California on October 3, 2018 and unsealed on October 17, 2018 in connection with the court\'s denial of the SEC\'s motion for ex part emergency relief, charges Dalius, Professional Realty Enterprises, Inc., Saivian LLC, Savings Network App LLC, Saving Network App Limited, Saivian International Limited, Saivian INT Limited, and Realty Share Network LLC with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Dalius is liable for the conduct of the Saivian corporate entities as their control person and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The complaint also names several relief defendants for the purpose of recovering funds that were unlawfully obtained. The SEC\'s litigation will be led by Kenneth Donnelly and Derek Bentsen with assistance from Kenneth Guido.

['The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Mark Suleymanov of Glen Cove, New York with engaging in an online binary options scheme that defrauded retail investors out of approximately $4 million. The SEC\'s complaint alleges that from at least 2012 to 2016, Suleymanov engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of binary options, which are securities that pay out depending on the outcome of a "yes/no" proposition, such as whether a specific equity security will close at or above a specified price on a given trading day.   Suleymanov promoted and sold the options on the SpotFN website and other related websites he controlled, and misrepresented the profitability of investing in the binary options, as well as investors\' ability to access their funds.  Suleymanov allegedly used software to manipulate investors\' trading results to increase investor losses, and prevented many investors from withdrawing their funds.  As alleged in the complaint, the SpotFN website also falsely stated that an investor\'s funds would be held in a separate account and used only for trading options, not for SpotFN\'s business expenses.  In fact, Suleymanov commingled investor funds in his bank accounts and misused certain of the funds for business and personal expenses. The SEC\'s complaint charges Suleymanov with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act.  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty.

According to the SEC\'s complaint, Goldman misled dozens of day traders into thinking they were opening individual online securities trading accounts with Goldman\'s broker-dealer, America Capital Group LLC, which was not registered with the SEC.  The SEC alleges that between at least November 2010 and August 2015, Goldman raised approximately $6.9 million from traders and then comingled their funds by placing them in a pooled master brokerage account that he controlled.  Goldman allegedly concealed the comingling of the funds by giving traders online access to individual sub-accounts within the pooled master account.  Goldman allegedly profited by charging traders a commission on their trades.  According to the SEC\'s complaint, the pooled account ultimately sustained at least $3.6 million in trading loses.  Because funds were commingled, traders were forced to share in the overall losses incurred in the master account.   The complaint further alleges Goldman made material misrepresentations and omissions to traders regarding his background and disciplinary history which includes antifraud and securities and broker-dealer registration injunctions, a broker-dealer bar, and a state court conviction for grand theft and forgery. The SEC\'s complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of Florida, charges Goldman with violating Sections 10(b), 15(a)(1), and 15(b)(6)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent and conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, and penalties.

Grenda, Jr., who was charged with violating a July 2015 Commission order barring him from association with an investment adviser and with aiding and abetting violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. According to the SEC's  , Walter Grenda continued to associate with Grenda Group, LLC - an entity he and his son, Gregory M. Grenda, formed in part to replace his previous investment advisory business, Reliance Financial Advisors, LLC - despite a July 2015 Commission order barring him from association with an investment adviser with the right to reapply after three years.  The SEC alleged, among other things, that Walter Grenda met with a prospective client and current clients in Grenda Group's offices and made discretionary changes to clients' investment accounts.  The SEC also alleged that Walter Grenda repeatedly impersonated his son on telephone calls to the firm's broker-dealer, after which the broker-dealer terminated its relationship with Grenda Group. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Walter Grenda consented to a final judgement, entered on December 7, 2018 by the Honorable Christina Clair Reiss in the Western District of New York, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) and the associational bar provision of Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act.  He was also ordered to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  In addition, on December 20, 2018, the Commission issued an order against Walter Grenda, barring him from association with an investment adviser, with no right to reapply.

The SEC   a brokerage consulting business known as GTS along with three of its former officers, including former CEO John T. Place, for misleading current and prospective customers about the fees the business charged in connection with securities transactions.  According to the SEC's complaint, Place and other GTS officers told many of their customers that GTS would receive only clearly disclosed commissions charged on customers' trades.  In reality, GTS also received additional revenue from mark-ups and mark-downs charged by other brokers. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Place consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. The amount of any financial penalty and disgorgement to be imposed against Place will be determined at a later date by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Place also consented to the entry of an SEC order, issued on December 20, 2018, barring him from the securities industry.

['SEC Charges a Taiwan-Based Insurance Company and a Former Insider with Fraudulent Market Manipulation Scheme']
['Litigation Release No. 24378 / December 21, 2018']
["A Taiwan-based insurance company and one of its former managers have agreed to settle fraud charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to a scheme to manipulate the company's trading volume. The complaint alleges that, from approximately December 2013 through March 2018, China United Insurance Service, Inc. and Cheng-Hsiung Huang schemed to deceive the investing public and Nasdaq, for the purpose of obtaining a listing on Nasdaq, that the trading volume in the company's stock was derived from bona fide market activity.  Huang, acting on the company's behalf, used multiple brokerage accounts to engage in numerous transactions in the company's stock.  When Huang's trading was flagged by a U.S.-based brokerage firm for high volume and possible prearranged trading and several of the accounts were frozen, Huang and two colleagues contacted the brokerage firm and lied about their identities, their relation to China United, and their reasons for trading. The SEC's complaint alleges that China United and Huang violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, China United and Huang agreed to the entry of a final judgment that enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders China United to comply with its undertaking to retain an independent compliance monitor, and orders Huang to pay a penalty of $30,000.  Based upon China United's cooperation with the SEC's investigation, the SEC is not seeking a monetary penalty against the company. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Gary M. Zinkgraf and Thomas Bednar and supervised by Jeffrey P. Weiss and Stephan Schlegelmilch.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."]
